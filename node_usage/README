Scripts to gather node usage data.

Only designed to work on Utah's testbed, but could be adopted to other
sites with some effort.

Before install:

  mkdir /usr/testbed/www/node_usage
  mkdir /usr/testbed/data/node_usage
  mkdir /usr/testbed/data/node_usage/data
  mkdir /usr/testbed/data/node_usage/scripts
  mysqladmin create node_usage

Than:
  
  make node_usage-install

And install a crontab entry in /etc/crontab:

  30	5	*	*	*	root	/usr/testbed/data/node_usage/scripts/refresh
