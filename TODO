*** Major:

* Fix the entire nalloc/nfree/reloading mechansism and the state
  control stuff for it that is scattered around nfree, tmcd, stated,
  and the reload daemon needs a complete overhaul. Many races, many
  oppotunities to fail. Mac is thinking about this.

* DB optimization, as per Daves email of Sun, 19 May 2002 10:35:54.
  Good one for Mac, who is good at this DB stuff! Also check cache
  sizes in the mysql config file.

  Related: Transient lost connections to DB. Requires find the last of
  the queries that do not go through the common interface, and putting
  in retry code.

  LBS: Thu May 23 - Added some of Dave's suggestion from his email.

* Event system startup cost. Abhijeet reported that after ISUP, it
  could take a very long time for events to start. This is because it
  takes a really long time to process the event stream in event-sched
  using Ian's original binary tree stuff. I hacked in a fix, but need
  to look at that algorithm and perhaps change. Need to decide if
  insertion needs to be optimized, over deletion.

* Specify maximum running time of a batch experiment.
  Ron Oldfield requested this, for the case when batches fail, they
  get stuck in the system. An alternative is an NS "at" event to stop
  the simulation (which we would have to convert into something, not
  sure what).

* Move flest to another machine?
  Related: Change flest to ignore certain tables, like idle stats to
  reduce DB churning. Could do it as a table of table names.

* Jail setup on wide area nodes. LBS: send email to Dave about using
  tunnels and our discussion the other day. 

* Need to default the OS id version (4.3, 7.1) if we are going to
  delay reloading, or else people can get old versions of the OS
  when in the same project (last_reservation). This might be moot
  depending on what we do wrt reloading when experiments are done.

* tmcd does not appear to be scaling with the advent of ssl. Rob
  suggested a combined tmcd command to return the entire node
  configuration in one message. We would still keep the individual
  calls, but provide a way to get all the data at once and save on a
  dozen connections per boot.

* Complete event system overhaul (per-exp elvind, secure elvind,
  per-node elvind, distribution of event lists to nodes).
  Cannot multicast events to multiple agents at a time.

* Get the program agent working on ron nodes. This is related (and
  dependent) on securing the event system.

* Deal with two ends of a remote link being allocated to the same ron
  node! Need to catch the situation for now (and error), but
  eventually make sure it does not happen since setting up a tunnel
  from a node to itself sound rather silly.

* Fix Dummynet crashes as reported Parveen.

* Dummynet validation. Error rates from Table 2 in the paper.

* Switch to ipsec AH tunnels for remote nodes. Faster than user mode
  ip in UDP.

* Fix mountd-invalidating-current-mounts problem.

* Fix the DHCP/TFTP bootstrap path: we talked about how to work around
  the BIOS DHCP failing, but I also had a couple of cases of corrupt
  MFSes while trying to do disk loads enmasse.

* Swapping support.

*** Medium:

* Front end support for changing delay/bw/plr asymmetrically in
  events. Currently, we can do queue params, but the basic delay, bw,
  and plr and can be only be done symmetrically.

  Related: Add NS event support for some of the tb- commands. For
  example, tb-set-lan-simplex-params. This is actually harder, since
  lans are not directly controllable at the link level anywhere in the
  system. delay_config chokes on lans at the moment for this reason.

* Fix up staticroutes to use lan nodes. Actually, I did most of this,
  but there was some question that Mike needed to answer about it.

* Change pipe specification on links so that its more clear. We
  currently use pipe0,pipe1 in some places, and the actual pipe
  numbers other places (the numbers reported by experiment setup).
  This makes it confusing to control pipes via the event system.
  Perhaps have the front end generate the pipe numbers so that
  everyone agrees on them (frontend, backend, tevc, delayagent,
  etc.). 

* Web page to control delay nodes (well, links). Would go nicely with
  Chads new vis tool that shows you the link characteristics.

* Support images with more than once slice (but not the entire disk).
  At present, people can make use of the 4th slice, but cannot save it
  with an image, unless they create an entire disk image, and we do
  not allow mere users to do that. The current disk image stuff is not
  flexible enough to support arbitrary slice definitions (save slice
  2-4).

  Related: Kill deltas!

* Add MBR initialization to all images, perhaps as a special Frisbee
  operation, like Mike did for slice 4. This is to prevent problems
  with people messing up the MBR.

* Dave requested that we get rid of . from the verification key
  when it falls at the end so as not to be confused with period.

* Daily experiment stats report sent by email. To include such things
  as:

 	#expts-created		success/fail	#PCs	Avg#PCs/expt?
 	#expts-terminated	""		""	""
 	#swapped-in		""		""	""
 	#swapped-out		""		""	""

  See Jays message to tbops of Fri, 19 Apr 2002.

* Web interface to "preload" experiment. Sorta like a syntax check
  that saves the virt state so it can be visualized, and later swapped
  in. Or perhaps this is an experiment create option.

  LBS: I added this, but its still an admin option.

* Change hardwired degree 4 for vrons->rons to more flexible DB
  management. Related would be dynamic creation of virtual nodes
  instead of hardwired entries in the nodes table, but thats a lot of
  work, and might not be worth it.

* Script to remove old log files from the mysql directory. Also remove
  old backups from the mysql backup dir. These files are taking up a
  huge amount of space, and /usr/testbed/log has been filling up a
  lot.

* Change exp failed email to report the actual failure mode based on
  result of assign_wrapper. Most users have no idea why an experiment
  failed.

* Add some kind of host table support to RON nodes so that programs
  can figure out IPs. This is going to be a pain.

* Support for protocols other than IP. Mike reported some issues
  related to this in email of Fri, 17 May 2002 10:05:41.

* Look at ganglia (http://ganglia.sourceforge.net) and other cluster
  management tools to see of we can leverage something from them,
  especially for widearea nodes.

  LBS: I did this. See message to tbops. 

* Add frontend syntax to control (widearea) solver weights. delay,
  bandwidth, plr.

  LBS: I did this, but Jay wants normalized numbers 

* Setup the other RON nodes at MIT.

* Find/Fix mysterious capture deaths.

* Web option to become another user (su). Might be possible after I
  clean up the auth stuff in the web page.

* Bring in a bug tracking system we can use from the web interface.
  Need someone to look around for this. I hate GNATS!
  Rob mentioned RT (http://www.fsck.com/projects/rt).

* CDROM installation of nodes.

* Retry/reliability to tmcd from ron nodes.

  LBS: I have been working on this.

*** Minor:

* Frisbee work. Mike/Rob reported that Frisbee "rocks" up to about
  50-60 nodes, and then goes south in a hurry. I reported a couple of
  optimizations in email that we could apply.

* Add support for ssh protocol 2 rsa/dsa keys. Requires minor changes
  to mkacct, and the three web pages that parse the keys.

* Move log files into experiment directory so that we can retain them
  for debugging. Right now the go to /tmp and get deleted when done.
  Could also add a web link to view the most recent log file. Related
  to current "view in real time" option.

* Link on web pages to pop up an ssh to a node. Perhaps do this by
  usurping the telnet client.

* Macrofy (remove hardwired) Utah Network Testbed string throughout
  the system (perl and php).

* Macrofy the signature of the email (currently "Testbed Ops").

* FAQ entry for lilo:
  To access partitions on the disk outside of the C:H:S tuple limit (8.4
  GB), you must add 'lba32' to the global options section.

  Not a big deal, but requires someone who knows lilo to verify and to
  test it.

* Change perl daemons to clean the environment so that email does not
  come from the person who ran it with sul!

* Fix "no networks link warning" to deal with remote node links.

* DB consistency checker; to run at night and as part of flest.

* Documentation page reorg. Need some reference material.

* Fix tbcmd test that broke comparing loss rate of 0.000 expected to
  0.013 obtained.

* node_reboot doesn't check if nodes exist before trying to ssh reboot
  and IPOD them.

* I'm sitting here looking at the "details" page for an experiment and
  no where obvious on this page does it show the name of the
  experiment.  If I scroll all the way down to experiment details,
  there it is. How about putting it over the vis image or making it
  part of the vis image? Somewhere right at the top.

* Copyright notices before we give code.
  Pat has a script.

* Save off ntp.drift problem.

* event system. skew and delay. unix domain socket to local proxy.

* When you're only a part of one project, could that project be the default
  value for the "choose a project" dropdown in "begin an experiment"?

* Add cleanup error handling (send email) in tb scripts.

* Sort osids in newimage pages.

* For example, boot up complains about no rc.route script.

* allow user to specify OSIDs for their delay nodes. Not entirely sure
  how, since delays are chosen late in the game, but at the moment its
  difficuly for people to customize delay nodes.

* Fix up hostnames generation from tmcd for lans. Currently, if you
  have a link and a lan to the same node, you get two aliases.

* Add web interface for generating simple hardwired topologies. ie:
  "Just give me some nodes in a lan."

This is some not well though out RON stuff:
* Add startup command for RON nodes. How to stop them? Jail?
* Add Jail.
* Add node_reboot of ron nodes.
* Add retry in wanassign.
