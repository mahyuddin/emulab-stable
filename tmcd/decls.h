 * As the tmcd changes, incompatable changes with older version of
 * the software cause problems. Starting with version 3, the client
 * will tell tmcd what version they are. If no version is included,
 * assume its DEFAULT_VERSION.
 *
 * Be sure to update the versions as the TMCD changes. Both the
 * tmcc and tmcd have CURRENT_VERSION compiled in, so be sure to
 * install new versions of each binary when the current version
 * changes. libsetup.pm module also encodes a current version, so be
 * sure to change it there too!
 *
 * Note, this is assumed to be an integer. No need for 3.23.479 ...
 * NB: See ron/libsetup.pm. That is version 4! I'll merge that in.
