# HACK: run dhclient on all interfaces, and do nothing else
#
# Note that this file's name (eth99) cannot overlap with an actual
# existing interface or dhclient will loop.  dhclient-script invokes
# the source-config function which sources the ifcfg-ethN file.  Thus
# if this script were called "ifcfg-eth0" and eth0 was the DHCPable
# interface, we would wind up recursively invoking dhclient (trust me,
# I tried it :-)

#
# If dhclient returns success, then it has configured the first interface
# and gone into background mode.  At that point we don't care about it any
# more and just kill it.  We also shutdown all the other interfaces (which
# dhclient will leave "up") and set ONBOOT=no to prevent ifup (our caller)
# from doing any further configuration on this fake interface.
