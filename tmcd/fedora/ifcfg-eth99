# HACK: run dhclient on all interfaces, and do nothing else
# (well, now also bring up a widearea node control net statically if asked)
#
# Note that this file's name (eth99) cannot overlap with an actual
# existing interface or dhclient will loop.  dhclient-script invokes
# the source-config function which sources the ifcfg-ethN file.  Thus
# if this script were called "ifcfg-eth0" and eth0 was the DHCPable
# interface, we would wind up recursively invoking dhclient (trust me,
# I tried it :-)
