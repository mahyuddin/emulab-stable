# In rc.conf, we have told it to just to configure lo0.  Then when the
# rc.d/dhclient script is executed, it sources this (/etc/rc.conf.d/dhclient)
# file where we identify all the actual interfaces and mark them as
# DHCPable.
#
# We do this work here rather than directly in rc.conf because rc.conf
# is sourced by every startup rc file and even some periodic scripts.
# No point in doing all this work a million times for no reason.
