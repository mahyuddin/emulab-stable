# Directions for setting up an XP image from scratch.
# These are raw notes and commands to paste into a shell.
# Mostly Bash shell commands for Windows, some tcsh commands for Boss or Ops.
# Some (most?) of it could be scriptified with some work. 

# Notice that this file has spaces instead of tabs at the beginning of lines.
# A tab in either Bash or tcsh causes it to display all of the possible command completions!
# Here's a little Emacs keyboard macro to ease the copy-and-paste business:
    ; Copy a command line, leaving off the whitespace on the beginning of the line.
    (fset 'copy-command-line [?\M-m ?\C-  ?\C-e ?\C-f C-insert])
    (global-set-key "\^C\^E" 'copy-command-line)

# By convention, optional "informational" commands are indented a couple of spaces more.
## Debugging and problem-solving stuff is double-# commented.

    . Start with a clean XP image, as it comes from the CD.

      - Swap in experiment Windows-1-base, log in as Administrator.

         . The experiment should be behind a firewall, to avoid contamination.

            # Firewall while making Windows images.
            set fw [new Firewall $ns]
            $fw set-type ipfw2-vlan
            $fw set-style basic

            # Allow Cygwin setup and Windows Update to work.
            $fw add-rule "allow tcp from any to any 80,443 in via vlan0 setup keep-state"

      - Set the Windows "w32time" NTP client to connect to the Emulab NTP host.

         . Runs as a service, periodically contacts the time server.
           ntp1 is a DNS alias for Ops.
           Need to restart w32time before it sees the setsntp configuration. (?)
             net time /querysntp
             net stop w32time
             net time /setsntp:ntp1
             net time /querysntp
             net start w32time
             # May take a couple of minutes to take effect.
             date
             
        . Need an NTP client, or at least the semblence of one.
            cat /etc/ntp.drift
          echo 0.000 > /etc/ntp.drift

      - Disable the Messenger Service to keep annoying pop-ups away.
            cygrunsrv -VQ  Messenger
          sc config Messenger start= disabled
          sc stop Messenger

      - Disable the SSDP Discovery Service and Universal Plug and Play Device Host.
        This closes port 5000 to attacks.  Also disable the Remote Registry service.
            cygrunsrv -VQ  SSDPSRV
            cygrunsrv -VQ  upnphost
            cygrunsrv -VQ  RemoteRegistry

          sc config SSDPSRV start= disabled
          sc config upnphost start= disabled
          sc config RemoteRegistry start= disabled

          sc stop SSDPSRV
          sc stop upnphost
          sc stop RemoteRegistry

      - Set the workgroup name to EMULAB in Control Panel/System/Computer Name/Change...
        No need to reboot yet.

      - Make a "root" account in Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Computer Management/
        System Tools/Local Users and Groups/Users, put it in the Administrators and Users groups.

        . While you're there, Right-click Start/"Explore All Users" and copy the Computer Management
          shortcut from Administrative Tools into the All Users/Desktop folder.

      - Start IE, make "blank" the home page. Click Tools/Internet Options/Home page/Use Blank.

      - Show My Computer.  (Desktop Properties/Desktop/Customize Desktop...)
        Turn off "Run Desktop Cleanup Wizard every 60 days".

      - Create C:/Temp, C:/Software/CygWin
      - Install CygWin
        . (Try copying /etc/setup/* from an existing image to save the selection work.)
        . Download setup from www.cygwin.com/setup.exe to C:/Software/CygWin, OR:
           # [On ops.]
           set pc=109
           scp /share/windows/cygwin-setup.exe $pc":"/tmp/setup.exe
        . Run it.  Install dir is C:\cygwin, package dir is C:\Software\CygWin .
            # Ensure that upgrading SSH won't hang.
            net stop sshd
            C:/Software/CygWin/setup.exe &
        . Mirror is http://mirrors.xmission.com .
        . Click [View] to "Not Installed" (alphabetical.)  
          Click on the Skip in the "New" column to add a binary version of:
            agetty, bison, cvs, cygrunsrv, ed, file, flex, gcc, gdb, inetutils, 
            make, minires-devel, nano, openssh, openssl-devel, 
            patch, perl, perl-libwin32, python, rpm, rsync, 
            shutdown, tcsh, vim, wget, zip .
          Click in the "src" column for openssh, so patches can be applied.
        . Don't "Create an icon on the Desktop", do "Add icon to Start Menu".

        . Add ;C:\cygwin\bin to the end of the System PATH in 
          Control Panel/System/Advanced/Environment Variables.

        . Start up a Cygwin shell and fix the shell properties:
            Options QuickEdit Mode on, Layout/screen buffer height 3000, window height 55.
            Check "Modify shortcut that started this window".
          - Might as well fix the Start/Programs/Accessories/Command Prompt properties, too.
          - Copy the bash shortcut to the All Users/Desktop.  
          - Copy it to a tcsh icon as well, changing the path to c:\cygin\cygwin-tcsh.bat .
          - Copy the tcsh icon into All Users/Start Menu/Programs/Cygwin.
          - Create c:\cygin\cygwin-tcsh.bat as a copy of c:\cygin\cygwin.bat with
              bash --login -i
            changed to
              tcsh -l

        . Set up local homedirs under /home as a symlink.  ~root is already there.
            cd /tmp
            mv /home{,.orig}
            ln -s /cygdrive/c/Documents\ and\ Settings/ /home

        . Symlink the Windows hosts file into the Cygwin /etc.
            ln -s /cygdrive/c/WINDOWS/system32/drivers/etc/hosts /etc/hosts

        . Create a proper group file.  Make wheel an alias for Administrators.
            mkgroup -l | \
              awk '/^Administrators:/{print "wheel" substr($0, index($0,":"))} \
                   {print}' > /etc/group.new
            diff /etc/group{,.new}
            cp -p /etc/group{,.prev}
            mv /etc/group{.new,}

        . Update the passwd file after creating new accounts.  Make root uid 0 with /home/root.
            mkpasswd -l | awk -F: 'BEGIN{ OFS=":" } \
               { if ($1=="root") $3="0"; else sub("/home/", "/users/"); print }' > /etc/passwd.new
            diff /etc/passwd{,.new}
            cp -p /etc/passwd{,.prev}
            cp -p /etc/passwd{.new,}
            chown root /etc/{passwd,group}*

        . Set up the syslog daemon.  (See usr/share/doc/Cygwin/inetutils-1.3.2.README)
            # Make sure /etc isn't owned by SYSTEM, which will prevent making syslogd.conf .
            chown root /etc
            syslogd-config -y
            # Start the daemon.  It starts automatically at reboot.
            net start syslogd
              # Test.
              logger "Test syslogd."
              tail /var/log/messages

        . Set up sshd.  
          - Edit /bin/ssh-host-config to add a -i argument to the "cygrunsrv -I sshd" lines.
                grep cygrunsrv /bin/ssh-host-config | grep -e -I
              ed /bin/ssh-host-config
              /cygrunsrv -I sshd/s//& -i/p
              /cygrunsrv -I sshd/s//& -i/p
              w
              q
          - Then start a Cygwin shell, stop sshd and remove its entry, run ssh-host-config:
            (You must be logged in as root over RDP, not ssh when you do this!)
                cygrunsrv -VQ sshd
              cygrunsrv -E sshd
              cygrunsrv -R sshd

              # May need to do some unmounts before running ssh-host-config.
              # It does a mount, and there's a hard-wired limit of 31 mount table entries.
              mount | wc -l
                ## mount: /ssh-host-config.3048: Too many mount entries
                for s in /users/s*; do umount $s; done

              regtool -v list /HKLM/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/sshd/Parameters

          - Edit /etc/sshd_config
            . Add AuthorizedKeysFile paths under /sshkeys/%u .
                  grep AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/sshd_config

        - The user registry key (folder) is created at first login, doesn't exist before that.
          Run setx after that at login time to set the HOME environment variable value.
                # Check.
                regtool get /HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run/SetHOME
          # Use the Windows command prompt rather than a script.
          regtool -s set /HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run/SetHOME \
            'cmd /C "if not %USERNAME% == root if not %USERNAME% == Administrator setx HOME //fs/%USERNAME%"'
                # Undo.

      . Patch sshd so that shares (including /users homedirs) work with public-key logins.
        Also touches a file when client input is received, so slothd will know.

        - RDP into a node as root and shut down all ssh processes before update.
          (Otherwise, installation of an openssh update can hang mysteriously.)
            net stop sshd
            ps -Welf | grep ssh

        - Go through Cygwin setup and make sure everything is updated.  
              cygcheck -c openssh
              /cygdrive/c/software/cygwin/setup.exe &
              cygcheck -c openssh
          . View "Partial" will show what it wants to download and install.
          . Also select src for openssh, which goes under /usr/src .
          . When base dll's are updated, it will tell you to reboot.  Do it.

        - Install the source patches.  (Go get CVSROOT and agent keys set above first.)
            (cd ~/flux; cvs update testbed/tmcd/cygwinxp)
              (cd ~/flux; cvs co testbed/tmcd/cygwinxp)
          cd /usr/src/openssh*
            v -t *.[ch] | head -30

          # Enable no-password ssh logins which can access shared homedirs.
          cp -p uidswap.c{,.orig}
            patch -p1 --dry-run < ~/flux/testbed/tmcd/cygwinxp/uidswap.c.patch
          patch -p1 -b < ~/flux/testbed/tmcd/cygwinxp/uidswap.c.patch
            diff uidswap.c{.orig,}

          # Enable slothd to know of the last SSH client input time.
          for f in channels.{h,c} serverloop.c; do cp -p $f{,.orig}; done
            v *.orig
            patch -p1 --dry-run < ~/flux/testbed/tmcd/cygwinxp/sshd-client-input-time.patch
          patch -p1 -b < ~/flux/testbed/tmcd/cygwinxp/sshd-client-input-time.patch

        - Configure.  Takes a while.
            # These are the options that contrib/cygwin/README specifies:
            prefix=/usr sbindir=/usr/sbin datadir=$prefix/share
            ./configure > configure.trace 2>&1 \
                --prefix=/usr \
                --sysconfdir=/etc \
                --libexecdir=${sbindir} \
                --localstatedir=/var \
                --datadir=${prefix}/share \
                --mandir=${datadir}/man \
                --infodir=${datadir}/info
              tail -f configure.trace

        - Just make and install sshd.exe, assuming everything else is up-to-date.
            make sshd.exe > make.log.1 2>&1
              tail -f make.log.1

            # Make sure sshd is closed down while installing.
            ps -Welf | grep sshd
            net stop sshd
            /usr/bin/install -c -m 0755 -s sshd /usr/sbin/sshd.exe
            net start sshd

      . Make a load average log for slothd, averaged over a 1 minute period.

        - /proc/loadavg is hard-wired to "0.00 0.00 0.00" on Cygwin now.

        - All attempts to script this setup to reproduce it on another computer have
          failed so far, including using its own "Save/Restore Settings" and
          transplanting the registry subtree.

       - Click into Computer Management / Performance Logs and Alerts / Counter Logs.
          Right-click "New Log Settings..." in the logs pane, 
            Name: "ldavg", OK.

          General tab, 
            Counters list, "Add Counters...",
              check "Use local computer counters",
              click "Add" to add % total processor (the default),
              click "Close".
            Sample data every: Interval: "60" seconds.

          Log Files tab, 
            Log file type: "Text File (Comma delimited)", 
            Uncheck "End file names with" so the result goes into ldavg.csv .
            Configure... 
              Location: "C:\cygwin\var\run",
              Log file size: "Limit of: 1 MB", OK.

          Schedule tab, 
            Start Log: Click "At" (which defaults to the current time, as well as the future.) 
            Stop Log: Click "When the 1-MB log file is full.",
              When a log file closes: "Start a new log file".

          Check all three tabs, click OK.

          # ldavg should start out red (stopped) and then turn green (started) if you
          # refresh with F5.  It will start again after reboot.
          # You can turn it off and on with the right-click menu on "ldavg" in the logs pane.  
            tail -f /var/run/ldavg.csv
          # The first one is always 99.999, etc.

      . Reboot to make sure it all works right.
          prepare
          /sbin/reboot


================================================================
Making images

    . Windows Update
      - This might be needed after each Microsoft "Patch Tuesday" (second tues of the month.)
      - Start up Internet Explorer and go to:
        . http://update.microsoft.com
           - The first time, just installs/updates the updater and asks to reboot.
           - I just choose the EXPRESS update, installing all high-priority updates.
           - Don't turn on Automatic Updates.

           - After rebooting, check again if there's more to install.

             To install SP2, you must have access to a console screen, because the
             Windows Firewall defaults to block both SSH and RDP.  Disable it.

             . You may need to free disk space to install SP2, or allocate a partition.
                   du -sm C:/WINDOWS/SoftwareDistribution/Download
                 rm -rf C:/WINDOWS/SoftwareDistribution/Download/*
                   du -sm C:/WINDOWS/ServicePackFiles/i386
                 find C:/WINDOWS/ServicePackFiles/i386 -type f | xargs rm -f

      - Could be a good time to update Cygwin as well.  
        . Beware of stepping on the sshd.exe patches.

     . Uninstall the experimental net devices in Computer Management/Device Manager.
       (This was from our attempts to make a pc850/pc600 image.  Is it needed?)
         # Check which one is the control net interface.
         ipconfig /all
       Select a non-control net interface, hit delete, enter.
       Takes about 15 seconds per interface.

     . Run prepare to clear out experiment-specific state.
        rootpc $pc
          # Ignore complaints about all of the C:/Documents and Settings directories
          # that were never created because the users didn't log in...
          prepare

          exit

    . Add an entry at the beginning of xpimage-log.txt, and create the image
      descriptor if it's not an existing image.

    . Capture the image with imagezip.  
      You can specify the PC from which to grab the image when you create an image-id.
      Do it in red-dot mode so you can set the Reboot Waittime to 240 seconds.
      When updating existing images, I do it by hand in two stages, as below.

              rootpc $pc /sbin/reboot
        # Wait until the node is in the MFS.
