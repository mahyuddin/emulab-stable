# Addresses to which email will be sent - These are expected to go to mailing
# lists. You can either host the lists on your ops node, send them off to
# some external server. If you chose to run them from the ops node, the
# ops-install script sets up empty lists for you.
#

# Main address for the 'operations staff' - Copies of error messages, etc. will
# get sent to this address, and in some cases users are directed to this
# address if they have questions and/or problems.
TBOPSEMAIL=netlab-ops@cc.gatech.edu

# Notification of new projects requests get sent to this address for approval.
# Should have a few admin-types on it.
TBAPPROVALEMAIL=netlab-admin@cc.gatech.edu

# Logs, such as experiment creation/deletion go to this address. Probably no
# more than one person needs to be on this one.
TBLOGSEMAIL=netlab-log@cc.gatech.edu

# Various auditing message about account maintenance go here. Again, probably
# only needs one member.
TBAUDITEMAIL=netlab-log@cc.gatech.edu

# Some web reports get sent to this one.
TBWWWEMAIL=netlab-ops@cc.gatech.edu

# Our node state management daemon sends mail to this address. Someone should

# good idea.

# of the testsuite, but is not used yet.
TBTESTSUITEEMAIL=netlab-log@cc.gatech.edu

# We dynamically create two email addresses for notifications to users - one
# for all testbed users, and one for all users whose projects have active
# experiments. These addresses are included in the above lists, with the
# intent that they can be used to archive all mail sent to them.
# XXX - ricci - I just have these going to the ops list right now, until
# an actual archive gets set up. Or maybe we don't need to do any archive,
# 'cause mailman will achive these?
