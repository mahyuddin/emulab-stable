Except for any files marked with the GNU Public License, or that bear
non-Utah copyrights and are unchanged from the original (eg, cracklib
and healthd), this emulab code snapshot has VERY RESTRICTED RIGHTS,
notwithstanding any per-file copyrights to the contrary.

This snapshot of the netbed/emulab code is for use only for your own
research or teaching, cannot be used for commercial purposes, and
CANNOT BE REDISTRIBUTED.  You must exercise reasonable precautions to
assure these conditions are met (e.g., make your group's members aware
of these restricted rights, and limit access to your group's members).

We later intend to provide a version that will be redistributable, and
have internal copyrights saying so.  When that is provided you must move
to that version, destroying this version.
