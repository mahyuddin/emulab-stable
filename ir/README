assign.tcl -
	This is a script that will take an IR with a topology section
and generates and appends the virtual and vlan sections.  It looks for
files testbed.ptop and macs.txt in the current directory.  It takes
one argument, the name of an ir file and generates a file "assign.log"
for debugging purposes.

testbed.ptop -
	The physical topology of the testbed.  At this point just a sample.

test.ir -
	A sample ir file.  Trivial case.

macs.txt -
	A dummy macs.txt file for testing purposes.
