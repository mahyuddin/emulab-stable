HyperViewer in Emulab - A wxGlade Python GUI on top of Tamara Munzner's 3D
hyperbolic graph viewer from Stanford.  This is a client program, connected to
the Emulab database via XML-RPC over SSH.

See the writeup in ../www/hyperviewer/index.html .

This is Very Alpha Software.  Until we get wxPython compatibility issues
resolved there will not be a binary distribution of the client.  Thus you need
to do a make from sources on the C++ part, which is imported by Python from a
shared library at runtime.  Before you can do that you must first have
wxPython installed, and wxGlade if you want to edit the GUI.  Then do a make
as described in the writeup.
