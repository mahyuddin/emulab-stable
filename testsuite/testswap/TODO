DOCS TODO
  backoff example

TODO
  TIMEOUT of XMLRPC Calls
  TESTLWP
  scp cleanup
  VERBOSENESS
  Add basic image-test parameterization examples
  EXAMPLES, Get some tests

STILL MESSY
  XMLRPC/Client/Experiment TestSuite/Experiment dsl

EXPAND CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
  event subsystem
  Test::Builder support

LATER
  Client.pm duplicate code elimination - Maybe this would make the code too unreadable
  test groupings
  Large External Tars and Resources for experiements
  buildup, teardown using Test::Class

Parallel TODOS
  clean up FFF, Roles, constructors
  CartProd teste - image test example
