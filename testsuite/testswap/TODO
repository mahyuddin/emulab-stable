DOCS TODO

TODO
  VERBOSENESS
  buildup, teardown using Test::Class
  create BSD virtual machine for testing
  Add basic image-test parameterization examples
  EXAMPLES
  traffic generation`
  convert more old tests
  general result code handling framework
  possibly collapse TestBed/XMLRPC/Client/* and TestBed/TestSuite
  possibly collapse tbts and t/harness

EXPAND CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
  event subsystem
  better parallel support (custom test harness) - functionality like image-test

LATER
  Client.pm duplicate code elimination - Maybe this would make the code too unreadable
  TestSuite::Experiment::Macros should be a monadic language like JQuery
  test groupings

DONE
  POD function documentation
  better general result code handling (ping_test single_node_test)
