DOCS TODO
  Overview / howto write a test

TODO
  cmdline params (-D)
  VERBOSENESS
  Add basic image-test parameterization examples
  EXAMPLES, Get some tests
  traffic generation
  convert more old tests
  general result code handling framework

STILL MESSY
  XMLRPC/Client/Experiment TestSuite/Experiment return codes, exceptions, composability
  Calling parallel tests 

EXPAND CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
  event subsystem
  parallel support (custom test harness)

LATER
  Client.pm duplicate code elimination - Maybe this would make the code too unreadable
  TestSuite::Experiment::Macros should be a monadic language like JQuery
  test groupings
  Large External Tars and Resources for experiements
  buildup, teardown using Test::Class
  create BSD virtual machine for testing
  possibly collapse tbts and t/harness

Parallel TODOS
  retry
  clean up FFF, Roles, constructors
  CartProd teste - image test example

DONE
  POD function documentation
  better general result code handling (ping_test single_node_test)
  ForkFramework Constants
