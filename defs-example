# Minimum Unix uid and gid values for Emulab users.
# Emulab will create the initial user with these values and all additional

# Main address for the 'operations staff' - Copies of error messages, etc. will
# get sent to this address, and in some cases users are directed to this

# We dynamically create two email addresses for notifications to users - one

# not back it up to tape).  If defined, you would either set no quotas,
# or higher quotas than for FSDIR_PROJ, on this filesystem.  If you are
# not providing guarantees and are not doing quotas, you might as well
# just put all your space in /proj and leave FSDIR_SCRATCH= blank.

# 254 physical nodes then the assignment code will increment Y, meaning
# that you had better have larger than a /16 network.  If you are using
