# Addresses to which email will be sent - These are expected to go to mailing
# lists. You can either host the lists on your ops node, send them off to
# some external server. If you chose to run them from the ops node, the
# ops-install script sets up empty lists for you.
#

# Main address for the 'operations staff' - Copies of error messages, etc. will
# get sent to this address, and in some cases users are directed to this
# address if they have questions and/or problems.

# Notification of new projects requests get sent to this address for approval.
# Should have a few admin-types on it.

TBWWWEMAIL=testbed-www@example.emulab.net

# We dynamically create two email addresses for notifications to users - one
