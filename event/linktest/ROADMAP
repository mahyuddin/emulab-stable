ROADMAP FOR LINKTEST

Description of files...

Name:
	linktest.c.in, linktest.h.in
Description:
	A daemon that waits for LINKTEST events.
Where it runs:
	On nodes only. It should be invoked by rc.setup
	so that it is running before any events arrive.
What it does:
	After receiving the START event, forks linktest.pl
	to conduct tests. Waits for linktest.pl to exit.
Who it should run as:
	experiment swapper
	

Name:
	linktest.pl.in
Description:
	A test suite for Emulab experiments.
Where it runs:
	On nodes only.
	The synch node does some extra processing, so it will
	cd to a directory where it finds tb_compat.tcl. Otherwise
	the directory is default.
What it does:
	Parses the experiment ns script, then conducts
	various tests for connectivity and link attributes.
	If errors are found, it saves them to a directory
	under tbdata for the experiment. It also sends
	a STOP event when all tests are completed.
Who it should run as:
	Invoked by linktest; therefore experiment swapper.

Name:
	ns-patchfile
Description:
	A patchfile for NS that adds extra data structures
	useful for parsing experiment datafiles.
Where it runs:
	The patched version of NS is run by the synch node in linktest.pl
	inside a directory where it can find tb_compat.tcl
What it does:
	N/A
Who it should run as:
	N/A

Name:
	tb_compat.tcl
Description:
	A modified version of testbed tb_compat.tcl that
	has support for parsing NS scripts using
	a patched version of ns (using ns-patchfile).
Where it runs:
	N/A
What it does:
	N/A
Who it should run as:
	N/A
