ROADMAP FOR LINKTEST

Description of files...

Name:
	linktest.c.in, linktest.h.in
Description:
	A daemon that waits for LINKTEST events.
Where it runs:
	On nodes only. It should be invoked by rc.setup
	so that it is running before any events arrive.
What it does:
	After receiving the START event, forks linktest.pl
	to conduct tests. Waits for linktest.pl to exit.
Who it should run as:
	experiment swapper
	

Name:
	linktest.pl.in
Description:
	A test suite for Emulab experiments.
Where it runs:
	On nodes only.
	The synch node does some extra processing, so it will
	cd to a directory where it finds tb_compat.tcl. Otherwise
	the directory is default.
What it does:
	Parses the experiment ns script, then conducts
	various tests for connectivity and link attributes.
	If errors are found, it saves them to a directory
	under tbdata for the experiment. It also sends
	a STOP event when all tests are completed.
Who it should run as:
	Invoked by linktest; therefore experiment swapper.

Name:
	ns-patchfile
Description:
	A patchfile for NS that adds extra data structures
	useful for parsing experiment datafiles.
Where it runs:
	The patched version of NS is run by the synch node in linktest.pl
	inside a directory where it can find tb_compat.tcl
What it does:
	N/A
Who it should run as:
	N/A

Name:
	tb_compat.tcl
Description:
	A modified version of testbed tb_compat.tcl that
	has support for parsing NS scripts using
	a patched version of ns (using ns-patchfile).
Where it runs:
	N/A
What it does:
	N/A
Who it should run as:
	N/A

Name:
	run_linktest.pl.in
Description:
	A script to run Linktest and report results.
Where it runs:
	Nodes, ops or boss.
What it does:
	Sends a START event to Linktest, then waits for the 
	STOP event. If errors were found, exit code is 1, else 0.
	Prints out contents of error files saved by Linktest.
	This script could be used by boss to run linktest when
	starting up the experiment.
	Important usage note: -q to skip the (time-consuming)
	bandwidth test.
Who it should run as:
	Experimenter.

Name:
	ltevent.c
Description:
	A program to either send an event or wait for an event.
Where it runs:
	Anywhere run_linktest.pl.in is called, or linktest.pl.in.
What it does:
	Accepts command line arguments to either send or wait for
	an event.
Who it should run as:
	Experiment swapper when invoked by linktest.pl;
	experimenter when invoked by run_linktest.pl
