Some notes about the TPM-enforced boot path (SECURELOAD state machine).

The current implementation requires that we boot from a flash device
BEFORE we network boot (see the paper for details).  Unfortunately,
there is a lot of magic associated with the PXEBOOTING state, which is
assumed to always be the first state we will see when a node boots.

However, in the secure boot path the first thing we see is a secure
transition to the GPXEBOOTING state, so magic had to be added for that!

In particular:

 * When stated gets a transition to GPXEBOOTING, it forces the node into
   the SECURELOAD op_mode.  This is a new trigger called SECURELOAD and
   a new trigger table entry:

   insert into state_triggers values \
       ('*','*','GPXEBOOTING','SECURELOAD');

 * Later, when we do get a PXEBOOTING state, we DON'T push the machine
   into the PXEBOOT op_mode.  We do this with an override trigger:

   insert into state_triggers values \
       ('*','SECURELOAD','PXEBOOTING','SECURELOAD');

   This is supposed to override the more general any ('*') op_mode trigger
   for the PXEBOOTING state and will just make sure we state in SECURELOAD.
