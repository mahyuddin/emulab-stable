For NSE based TCP traffic generation, we need the following files
as part of the FBSD disk image or it should be part of 
/usr/testbed/sup/sup/FBSD43-STD/root*/etc/testbed on the boss node.

a) nseinput.tcl and startnse present in this directory
b) NSE executable file. To build it, do a "cvs co ns-2" in this
   directory or elsewhere. The main branch of the ns-2 cvs tree
   will contain the latest files to build an NSE suitable for
   emulab.

   cvs co ns-2
   cd ns-2
   ./install
   cp ns-2.1b8a/nse <sup_directory>

The current NSE trafgen comes with a major caveat:

0) It comes with all the bugs and idiosyncrasies of the FullTcp, FTP and
   Telnet models in NS.

Here is an example scenario:

source tb_compat.tcl
set ns [new Simulator]

#Create four nodes
set nodeA [$ns node]
set nodeB [$ns node]

$ns duplex-link $nodeA $nodeB 100Mb 0ms DropTail

##### ftp0
set tcp0 [new Agent/TCP/FullTcp/Tahoe]
$ns attach-agent $nodeA $tcp0
set ftp0 [new Application/FTP]
$ftp0 attach-agent $tcp0

set tcp1 [new Agent/TCP/FullTcp/Sack]
$ns attach-agent $nodeB $tcp1
$tcp1 listen

#Connect the traffic sources with the traffic sink
$ns connect $tcp0 $tcp1  

##### telnet0
set tcp2 [new Agent/TCP/FullTcp/Newreno]
$ns attach-agent $nodeB $tcp2
set telnet0 [new Application/Telnet]
$telnet0 attach-agent $tcp2

set tcp3 [new Agent/TCP/FullTcp]
$tcp3 listen
$ns attach-agent $nodeA $tcp3

$ns connect $tcp2 $tcp3

$ns at 30.0 "$ftp0 start"
$ns at 120.0 "$ftp0 stop"
$ns at 60.0 "$telnet0 start"
$ns at 90.0 "$tcp2 set segsize_ 256; $tcp3 set segsize_ 512"
$ns at 150.0 "$telnet0 stop"

#Run the simulation
$ns run
