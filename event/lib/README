To isolate the pain of building threaded (and statically linked) event
system programs, we build two versions of the event library, one for
non threaded programs and another (libevent_r.a) for threaded
versions. Threaded clients require a bunch of extra link goo, but at
the moment the only threaded client is the event scheduler.  If you
try and use the threaded API without the proper link, the library will
print an error message and quit.
