This directory contains support for remote booting of PCs via Intel's PXE
(Preboot eXecution Environment) which is supported on ethernet cards like
the eepro100.

A client PC equipped with such a card and configured to boot from the network
first does the following:

1. the LAN card uses DHCP to get its IP info from a standard DHCP server
2. as PXE requires DHCP extensions, and thus cannot use may standard DHCP
   servers, so it gets redirected to a Proxy DHCP server (proxydhcp* in
   this directory)
3. This server tells the client which boot program to download via TFTP
   and the client does so.

The above steps are not specific to the testbed.  Starting with the execution
of the downloaded boot program, a testbed specific protocol takes over:

4. The PXE-loaded boot program (pxeboot from the OSKit) speaks a custom hack
   UDP protocol ("defined" in oskit/boot/bootwhat.h) with yet another server.

5. This server (bootinfo* in this directory) is responsible for determining,
   in a testbed-specific way, what action should be performed by the client.
   This action is either boot from a specific partition on the hard disk
   or download (via TFTP) a particular multiboot OSKit kernel (e.g., netboot)

6. Finally, pxeboot transfers control either to the first-level boot code
   in the indicated hard disk partition or to the OSKit kernel it has just
   downloaded.
