Line format 3 for libnetmon:

<Command>: <Key> <Timestamp> <Value>

<Command> describes the kind of connection
<Key> is a unique key for the connection
<Timestamp> is a decimal number representing absolute time
<Value> is a command-dependent string

Possible commands and their values:

New (value is 'TCP' or 'UDP')
RemoteIP (value is a dotted quadruplet describing destination IP address)
RemotePort (value is a number representing the remote port of the connection)
LocalPort (value is a number representing the local port of the connection)
TCP_NODELAY (int)
TCP_MAXSEG (int)
SO_RCVBUF (int)
SO_SNDBUF (int)
Connected (no value) (RemoteIP and RemotePort MUST be sent before this command)
Send (value is the size of the write or sendto)
SendTo (value is <localPort>:<remoteIP>:<remotePort>:<size>
Closed (no value)

On a TCP connection, there should be the following sequence:

New
(TCP_NODELAY|TCP_MAXSEG|SO_RCVBUF|SO_SNDBUF|RemoteIP|RemotePort)*
Connected
LocalPort
Send*
Closed

On a UDP connection, there should be the following sequence:

New
Connected?
(SO_RCVBUF|SO_SNDBUF)*
SendTo*
Closed
