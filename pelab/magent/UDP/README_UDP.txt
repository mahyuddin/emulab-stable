				ACIM for UDP applications 
				-------------------------

Contact: pramod@cs.utah.edu

Overview:
---------

UDP for Flexlab is implemented as two stand alone programs as of now - 
it will soon be integrated into the exisiting Magent code.

The client applications sends UDP packets to the server at a specified rate. The
client records a timestamp for each packet sent and for each ACK received. The
server sends acknowledgements ( with some redundancy built in ) back to the client.

Based on the time taken for these acks to get back, since the original packets were
sent out: the client calculates the RTT,
the minimum delay ( which is interpreted as all delay except queuing ) ,the maximum
queuing delay, and the achieved throughput.

It has been tested in Emulab, with background cross traffic generated by IPerf TCP and
UDP sessions. I will check in the resulting throughput graphs soon.

How to run it:
--------------

Start the server program first:

1) cd to 'UdpServerDir'
2) Type 'make -f Makefile.server'
3) ./runServer.sh

Then start the client app ( on a different host ):

1) cd to 'UdpClientDir'
2) Type 'make -f Makefile.client'
3) ./runClient.sh

Depending on the arguments given in 'runClient.sh', the client app sends
some number of UDP packets to the server and calculates the achieved throughput values.

The client runs in an infinite loop and (as of now) does not terminate on its own, so 
kill it after it stops printing to stdout.

4) Then type './showTputGraph.sh' in 'UdpClientDir'. This displayes a graph
of the throughput values for the session. ( Make sure that gnuplot is present on the system ).


Results and graphs:
