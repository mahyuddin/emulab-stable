1.112: Made it illegal to put NULL values in interfaces.iface.
       Run this first to make sure you don't have any (fix if you
       do). 
       
	select * from interfaces where iface is null;
	
1.113: Add disktype to node_types for Mike:

	alter table node_types add disktype enum('ad','da','ar') \
		default NULL after control_iface;

       Used by frisbee/imagezip. Locally, changed these types:

	update node_types set disktype='ad' where type='pc600';
	update node_types set disktype='ad' where type='pc850';
	update node_types set disktype='ad' where type='pc1500';
	update node_types set disktype='ad' where type='pcL440GX';
	update node_types set disktype='ad' where type='pc2000';
	update node_types set disktype='ad' where type='pc601';

1.114  Add nextosid slot to os_info table for mapping the generic
       osids (RHL-STD) to a specific one. Primarily used in os_setup
       to figure out what to do with the generic names, but might also
       be used someday to migrate people to newer versions?

        alter table os_info add nextosid varchar(35) default NULL \
	        after op_mode;

	update os_info set nextosid='RHL71-STD' where \
		osid='RHL-STD';
	update os_info set nextosid='emulab-ops-FBSD47-STD' where \
		osid='FBSD-STD';

       Note that the osids are a little odd on boss, where the early
       ones had osid=osname. On other testbeds, need to check the
       actual value of the osids.
