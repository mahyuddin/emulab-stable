Our\r\n      messages usually do not get flagged as spam by most filters, but\r\n      in certain cases it can be a problem.

Can I designate TAs?','    Yes. To designate a TA, you must first create a project\r\n    <em>group</em>. A project group is a lot like a unix group, and\r\n    in fact unix groups is the mechanism used to protect members of\r\n    one group from members of another group. When you create a group,\r\n    you designate a <em>group leader</em> who is responsible for\r\n    approving users who apply to join the group. Group leaders may\r\n    also terminate experiments that have been created by members of\r\n    the group. As Project Leader, you may also shift members of your\r\n    project in and out of your project\'s groups as you like, and you\r\n    are automatically a member of all groups within your project. As a\r\n    convenience, all new projects are created with one new group,\r\n    termed the <em>default group</em>. As its name implies, whenever\r\n    the group is left unspecified in a form, it defaults to the\r\n    project group (this allows you to create a project without any sub\r\n    groups at all; new members join the default group, new experiments\r\n    are created in the default group, etc.).\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Project groups are created via the Project Information link at\r\n    your left.

It includes a log of the setup process which,\r\n    while not a model of clarity, often contains an obvious indication of what\r\n    happened.\r\n    <p>\r\n    One potential point of failure is the mapping phase where Emulab\r\n    attempts to map your topology to the available resources.  Look\r\n    in the log for where it runs <code>assign</code>.  Common errors\r\n    here include:\r\n    <ul>\r\n    <li> Your topology that requires more physical nodes than\r\n    are currently available.  There should be a message of the form:\r\n    <pre>\r\n    *** NN nodes of type XX requested, but only MM found\r\n    </pre>\r\n    in the log.  You should always check the free node count on the left\r\n    menu before trying an experiment swapin.  Keep in mind that shaped\r\n    links might require additional traffic-shaping nodes above and beyond\r\n    nodes that are explicit in your topology.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <li> Your topology requires too many links on one node.\r\n    Currently you can have no more than four links per node unless\r\n    you use\r\n    <a href=/doc/docwrapper.php3?docname=linkdelays.html#EMULINKS>\r\n    multiplexed links</a>.\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the setup log shows <code>assign</code> failing repeatedly and\r\n    eventually giving up, \r\n    <a href=\"kb-show.php3?xref_tag=problem-reporting\">contact us</a>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The next potential failure point is the setup of the physical\r\n    nodes.  If you are explicitly setting the OS image to use with\r\n    <code>tb-set-node-os</code>, then make sure you have specified\r\n    a valid image (e.g., did you spell the OS identifier correctly?)\r\n    Again, the log output should include an error if the OSID was\r\n    invalid.\r\n    <p>\r\n    Click <a href=\"https://www.emulab.net/showosid_list.php3\">List ImageIDs and\r\n    OSIDs</a> in the Emulab web interface \"Interaction\" pane to see the\r\n    current list of Emulab-supplied OSs.\r\n    <p>\r\n    If the OSID is correct, but the log contains messages of the form:\r\n    <pre>\r\n    *** Giving up on pcXXX - it\'s been NN minute(s).\r\n    *** WARNING: pcXXX may be down.\r\n    This has been reported to testbed-ops.\r\n    </pre>\r\n    then a node failed to reach the point where it would report a successful\r\n    setup to Emulab.\r\n    <p>\r\n    Near the end of the experiment setup, Emulab\'s event system can fail to\r\n    startup with a message like this:\r\n    <pre>\r\n      Starting the event system.\r\n      *** ~/.ssh/identity is not a passphrase-less key\r\n          You will need to regenerate the key manually\r\n      *** /usr/testbed/devel/stack/sbin/eventsys.proxy:\r\n          Failed to start event system for foo/bar\r\n    </pre>\r\n    Or, like this:\r\n    <pre>\r\n      Starting the event system.\r\n      Permission denied, please try again.\r\n      Permission denied, please try again.\r\n      Permission denied.\r\n      *** /usr/testbed/devel/stack/sbin/eventsys.proxy:\r\n          Failed to start event system for foo/bar </pre>\r\n    This failure occurs because you have manually changed your default SSH\r\n    identity (~/.ssh/identity) or edited your authorized_keys file in your\r\n    Emulab home directory without going through the \"Edit SSH Keys\" web form on\r\n    your user page.  The easiest way to fix this is to make sure the passphrase\r\n    is empty using ssh-keygen(1) on the user\'s machine:\r\n    <pre>\r\n      users$ ssh-keygen -p -P \"<old-passphrase>\" -N \"\" -f ~/.ssh/identity\r\n    </pre>\r\n    Then, make sure the corresponding public key in your Emulab home directory\r\n    (\"~/.ssh/identity.pub\") is listed in the \"Edit SSH Keys\" form.\r\n    <p>\r\n    Such failures can be caused by many things.  Sometimes\r\n    a transient load on an Emulab server can push a node over its\r\n    timeout, though this is happening less and less as we\r\n    improve our infrastructure.  Most often, these failures are caused\r\n    by the use of custom images which either do not boot or do not\r\n    self-configure properly.  These are harder to dianose because you\r\n    often need access to the console logs to see what happened,\r\n    and these logs aren\'t available after an experiment fails.\r\n    However, it is possible to interactively monitor\r\n    the console while the experiment is setting up since console access\r\n    is granted early in setup process.  You can either use the\r\n    <code>console</code> command on users, use the\r\n    <a href=\"#UTT-TUNNEL\">tiptunnel</a> client application,\r\n    or just run \"tail -f\" on the <code>/var/log/tiplogs/pcXXX.run</code>\r\n    file.\r\n    </p>\r\n','troubleshooting',1,'2005-08-16 13:46:10','stoller',0,NULL,NULL);

For a reliable window based protocol such as TCP,\r\n    the window size represents the number of unacknowledged bytes. TCP\r\n    needs to keep the unacknowledged bytes around until the acks for\r\n    them are received. These bytes are retained in socket buffers. On\r\n    a link/LAN with bandwidth B and round-trip-time (RTT) D, the\r\n    sender TCP needs to be able to transmit B times D bytes before\r\n    expecting any acknowledgement, if the data pipe has to be kept\r\n    full. The effective sending window is dependent on receiver\r\n    advertised window besides other things. It is necessary to have\r\n    sender and receiver socket buffers at least as high as BxD. If you\r\n    only care about optimal end-to-end TCP throughput, then the socket\r\n    buffers need to be BxD where B is the bandwidth of the bottleneck\r\n    link and D is the end-to-end RTT.
