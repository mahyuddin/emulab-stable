Things to do for image*:

1. Checksum chunks or the entire image file?
   Maybe just as a debug option to check for bugs in the zipper itself.
   In general use, we will be using TCP as the transport for image files
   or we will be using frisbee and the UDP checksum in conjunction with
   frisbee itself tracking blocks should be sufficient.  Anyway, doing
   an entire image checksum would be complicated by frisbee's out of order
   receipt of chunks.

2. Imagezip could be multithread so that we can be reading ahead on the
   input device and overlapping IO with compression.  Maybe a third thread
   for doing output.  Input is a little tricky since imagezip shortens up
   its reads as it gets near the end of a chunk, so the buffer mechanism
   will have to handle having blocks only partially consumed.

3. In imagezip, split out the FS-specific code into subdirectories.
   [DONE]

4. Write an imageconvert so that we can convert old version images into
   new ones and maybe change the compression level used in an image.

5. Imageunzip could be triple-threaded like frisbee, i.e., split the
   file reading and decompression that are currently one in imageunzip.

6. Create a "signature" file for an image using a collision-resistant hash
   like MD5 or SHA-1.  See TODO.hash for more.
