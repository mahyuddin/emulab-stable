Things to do for netdisk and imagezip:

1. Need an unimagezip.

2. Header should include a checksum of the data.
   Should be a header checksum as well.

3. Netdisk should have an option to make a checksum pass over the disk
   after the image has been loaded.

4. Netdisk should have a command to print out the DOS partition table and
   any embedded disklabels.

5. Netdisk should should have a non-interactive mode, taking commands as
   arguments on the command line.

6. When interactive, netdisk should possibly not reboot after loading the
   image, allowing one to load another partition or check on the partition
   table.
