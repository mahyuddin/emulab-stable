NTFS support.  Requires the Linux NTFS support:
http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/

In the future it is our hope to get our changes incorporated into the
Linux NTFS main distrubution.  However at this current time a CVS
version is needed for this to work and then you need some changes that
I made to the CVS version to make the library work on FreeBSD on top
of that.  In the future we hope to get our changes merged with the
Linux NTFS project.  However for the time being to get a working NTFS
library you must contact Russ Christensen (rchriste@cs.utah.edu).
