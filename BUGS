*** cvsupd. - Sep 17 2001 - Needs to be fixed

The old version of cvsupd had the billenium bug, whereby number of
seconds since the epoc is greater than 1billion, and thus breaking
cvsupd. Upgrading was a disaster on Linux. It appears the new version
was trashing the boot block in Linux, and so nodes were not booting
after a cvsupd run.


*** mountd/exports - Sep 17 2001 - Needs to be fixed

Reported by Matt on Sep 17 2001, but actually a known bug with the
exports_setup script and the current mountd/kernel impl, which wipes
out all mounts before installing the new set.  This causes transient
failures in NFS access from the testbed nodes since the mounts become
momentarily invalid.


*** Batch Mode Nots - Sep 18 2001 - Needs to be fixed

Reported by Mike.

Nit: experiment create date in Experiment Info "header" is not set.
Is this field meaningless or just not filled in correctly?

Nit: there are two "header" tables shown
I assume this is bacause the batch code prints out a header and then calls
the regular experiment info script to do the rest.  Anyway, the second table
is missing lots of date info as well.

Nit: web page for expr takes forever to show the nodes that were allocated.
For a regular experiment, the allocated nodes show up almost immediately,
presumably as soon as assign is done.  For a batch experiment, it seems to
take minutes.  I can go out and look at assign.log and see that nodes have
been assigned almost right away, they just doesn't wind up in the report
(the DB?) for awhile.


*** Shell experiments - Sep 18 2001 - Needs to be fixed

Reported by Rob.

Perhaps a feature instead of a bug. Shell experiments remain in the
"new" state, and are thus not cleaned up (nodes frees) when the
experiment is terminating. I view that as intended behaviour, but its
easy to change, so we should.


*** Broken lilo.conf - Sep 17 2001 - Needs to be fixed.

Reported by Matt (and then Rob).

According to Matt, our lilo.conf file is broken. In the next version
of the disk image, we should fix it. Matt sent a fixed version to
testbed-ops on Sep. 17 that we could use as a base.


*** IPOD support - Sep 17 2001 - Needs to be fixed.

Reported by Rob.

Our Linux kernel needs to be rebuilt with ping of death support.
