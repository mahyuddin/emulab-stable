Plans for the control switch VLANs, and description of which traffic should
(and should not) be allowed to cross between VLANs.

***** VLAN Mebers

* External: Just the wire to the Netcomm router

* Public: Plastic

* Private: paper, power controllers, IP interfaces to switches

* Control: All testbed nodes control network interfaces

***** What to allow

1) External <-> Private
   ssh             for logging in
   http            web server
   smtp            outbound, mail sent from the web server
   ntp             time synch
   dns             name server
   nsr             networker filesave to/from envy
   
2) External <-> Public
   ssh             for logging in
   high ports      for user proxies
   nsr             networker filesave to/from envy
   smtp            outbound, mail
   nfs             only to .212 subnet
   snmp            get machine information
   
3) External <-> Control
   ssh             for logging in
   hight ports     allow users to run their own 
   snmp            get machine information
   
4) Private <-> Public
   ssh             as always
   nfs             plastic:/proj mounted on paper
                   plastic:/users mounted on paper
                   paper:/usr/testbed/tftpboot/proj on plastic
   ntp             time
   dns             name server
   
5) Private <-> Control
   ssh             as always
   ntp             time synch                                                      
   dns             name server
   dhcp            including forwarded broadcasts                                  
   proxydhcp       extended DHCP support (for PXE)                                 
   tftp            for loading pxeboot, pxeboot loading multiboot kernels
   bootinfo        pxeboot <-> bootinfo daemon                                     
   tmcd            the testbed master control daemon
   nfs             images from netdisk
   
6. Public <-> Control
   ssh             as always
   nfs             /users, all FSes for dnards
                   plastic:/proj on node:/proj
		   plastic:/q/tftpboot/proj from netdisk
   high ports      talk to user proxies on plastic
   snmp            get machine information
