In case of emergency!

Booting paper/plastic/tipserv1
------------------------------

The tip lines for each of paper/plastic/tipserv1 are on snake.cs.utah.edu.
(standard desktop machine).

You can talk to power controller number 9 from snake by using "tip
apc" to talk to power9. User is "apc", password is written on the
white board in the flux area.  The outlets are set up as follows:

	plastic   - 8 
	paper     - 6 
	cyclades2 - 5 
	cyclades1 - 7 

The boot blocks are set up so that they will let you interrupt the
boot on the VGA, but if you leave that alone, the last stage loader
will run on the serial line. You can interrupt the boot there.

Note that Mike and I built/installed new boot blocks on paper/plastic
and snake that run at 115200. The defaul is 9600 for all 3 stages.
