Here's what needs to be done in order to get the sharks working:

DONE: Get our new ranges of IP adresses working

MAC/DSL??: Run crossover cables from the 2nd 100Mbps port on the Asante
  switches to control router. One way to do this would be to use cables leftover
  from elsewhere in the testbed, cut one end off, and crimp a new end on. Or, we
  could get some real bulk cable and do both ends ourselves.  Or, we could buy
  them from someone.

ROB: Create a new private VLAN to contain the sharks.

ROB: Do DHCP forwarding from this new VLAN to paper. This seems to be called
  the 'UDP Helper Address' by Cisco. Docs (probably not for the right version
  of IOS) can be found at:
  http://www.ieng.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/access/acs_fix/827/827swcfg/routcfig.htm

ROB: Allow routing from the new VLAN to paper, plastic and the outside world.
  This might be a problem - What routing behavior is possible in a private
  VLAN? Do we somehow need to make the router interface the promiscous port for
  the private VLAN?
	
LEIGH: Get tmcc for Sharks. Shouldn't have to be very different from the
  FreeBSD version, except that it needs to set an alias for the interface,
  instead of a 'real' IP address. (Or is this on the tmcd side??)
	
???: Review bootup process (DHCP, kernel, NFS) and find hardcoded IPs (gateway?
  NFS server? name server? ???) Use names where possible to avoid doing this
  again.
  
MAC: Go through the tbscripts, and locate places where the 8->1 mapping problem
  could be manifested (known one is assign-wrapper)

???: Come up with some reason to use them (could be the hardest part!!) :)
