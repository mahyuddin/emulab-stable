Here's what needs to be done in order to get the sharks working:

* Get our new ranges of IP adresses working

* Run crossover cables from the 2nd 100Mbps port on the Asante switches to
  control router. One way to do this would be to use cables leftover from
  elsewhere in the testbed, cut one end off, and crimp a new end on. Or, we
  could get some real bulk cable and do both ends ourselves.  Or, we could buy
  them from someone.

* Create a new private VLAN to contain the sharks.

* Do DHCP forwarding from this new VLAN to paper. This seems to be called
  the 'UDP Helper Address' by Cisco. Docs (probably not for the right version
  of IOS) can be found at:
  http://www.ieng.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/access/acs_fix/827/827swcfg/routcfig.htm

* Allow routing from the new VLAN to paper, plastic and the outside world.
  This might be a problem - What routing behavior is possible in a private
  VLAN? Do we somehow need to make the router interface the promiscous port for
  the private VLAN?
	
* Get tmcc for Sharks. Shouldn't have to be very different from the FreeBSD
  version, except that it needs to set an alias for the interface, instead of a
  'real' IP address. (Or is this on the tmcd side??)
	
* Look through the NFS images the sharks mount (and their kernel) for
  hardcoded IPs, etc. and update them, or (better yet), figure out a way to
  generalize if possible
  
* Go through the tbscripts, and locate places where the 8->1 mapping problem
  could be manifested

* Come up with some reason to use them (could be the hardest part!!) :)
