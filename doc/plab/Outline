Evolving design_document/techreport/paper on Emulab's frontend to Planetlab.

It will start as mostly "features" and "design/implemenation",
with the design/impl being an informal account of how
it works, as an internals document for us.

That will be releasable/public.

It will evolve into a TR, also releasable.

Then some version of it will evolve into a real paper
(with eval, more spin, etc).


OUTLINE

Title: Emulab's PlanetLab Backend
  % Emulab's Portal to PlanetLab

Introduction

Motivation

Goals/Requirements

Features
  Also describe it in terms of ``services'', from llp's 10/03 slide

	His service taxonomy:
	Slice == Experiment Portal
		Create expt/slice
			Resource Discovery [w/ Monitoring Service]
			Resource Allocation
			Boot Slice [w/ Environment Service]

		Maintain expt/slice
			Software Upgrades [w/ Environment Service]
			Monitor Health [w/ Monitoring Service]
			Project membership

		*Control expt/slice
			Node 
			Expt

	* = Not in llp's taxonomy; Elab-only

	As of 10/03 Plab people were developing; did not have anything:
	  Environment Service
	  Monitoring Service
	  Resource allocation


Design
[for first version, probably keep design and impl together, for
ease of brain-dumping]

	Rob:
	-Assign and node selection
	-SW distrib and update (state mgmt, hierarchical)
	-Startup commands
	  (Wide-area event system)
	
Implementation

Evaluation
	SWE:
		Integration with rest of Elab's design and code
	dslice perf
	PLC/NM perf
