Information necessary for keeping boss and ops node up-to-date. This
file contains updates that must be made outside of the database and
the intall tree (ie. /usr/testbed).

This file is in the same format at the FreeBSD UPDATING file, whis is
to say, in reverse chronological order, with the date of the change
in YYYYMMDD format.

20040615:
	If you update the ports on your boss node, you'll need to take
	into accout that FreeBSD is in the process of changing how its
	rc.d scripts work - add the following two lines to the bottom
	of your /etc/rc.conf on boss:
	  dhcpd_enable="YES"
	  apache_enable="YES"

20040601:
	The p5-Time-HiRes port is now required on both boss and ops -
	install it from /usr/ports/devel/p5-Time-HiRes .

20040420:
	Switched web search button backend from webglimpse to swish-e.
        Just need to go to /usr/ports/www/swish-e and install the port.

20040303:
	Fixed the way we handle the certificate for capture with tiptunnel.
	We no longer hard-code the certificate digest in nodetipacl.php3 .
	However, as a result, we must place this fingerprint in a publically-
	readable file on boss. So, if you have serial lines that you're
	running with capture:
	1) Copy your /usr/testbed/etc/capture.pem file from your tipserver to
	boss, if it isn't there already.
	2) In /usr/testbed/etc/ on boss, run: 'openssl x509 -sha -noout
	-fingerprint -in capture.pem > capture.fingerprint', and make this
	file world-readable.

20040302:
	Changed the length of the node_id columns from 10 to 32. Make sure
	you re-compile and restart all daemons written in C (such as
	tmcd, tevd, and the event schedulers) before putting any nodes in
	the database with names longer than 10 characters.

20040226:
	Re-worked the way named_setup handles virtual nodes and unroutable
	IP addresses - no point in handling the two differently. Thus, the
	'vnodes.<OURDOMAIN>.db' DNS zone file is no longer generated.
	Instead, if you have a mix of routable and unroutable IP addresses,
	you'll need to switch to using the '<OURDOMAIN>.internal.db' zone
	file - see Step 6 of doc/setup.txt for instructions on setting up
	this file.

20040121:
	Changed the 3.testbed.sh rc.d script to handle 'start' and 'stop'
	arguments properly. Install a fresh copy of rc.d/3.testbed.sh into
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d .

20040120:
	Bumped up the sizes on some buffers to help network performance.
	Add the following two lines to /etc/sysctl.conf:

	net.local.dgram.maxdgram=65536
	net.local.dgram.recvspace=65536


20040112:
       Big change to bootinfo sequence.

       * Update DB with new contents of sql/database-fill.sql *and
         sql/database-fill-suplement.sql.
       * Rebuild pxeboot kernel from source (src/sys/boot/i386/emuboot).
         Install emuboot to /tftpboot/pxeboot.emu
       * Install new version of dhcpd.conf file that has all the PXE
         crap removed and includes the single line:

		filename "/tftpboot/pxeboot.emu";

       * Restart dhcpd. 
       * Kill proxydhcp. Be sure to install new 3.testbed.sh from the
         rc.d directory to /usr/local/etc/rc.d, or just edit in place
       * Restart bootinfo.
       * Restart stated.
       * Reboot all non allocated nodes so that they go into pxewait mode.

20031215:
	The mod_php4 port on boss should be recompiled with the
	'xmlrpc' option, in addition to the 'mhash' option already
	used. Apache on boss will need to be restarted after the new
	port is installed.
