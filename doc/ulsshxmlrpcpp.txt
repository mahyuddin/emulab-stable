ulsshxmlrpcpp
-------------

The ulsshxmlrpc library is a lightly customized version of the
ulxmlrpcpp library, it's used in the testbed by the event scheduler.
The following are some bits of information for maintaining the
package:

  * CVS Repository
	cvs.flux.utah.edu:/flux/ANONCVS

  * Original source
	http://ulxmlrpcpp.sourceforge.net/

	Importing a new version should be done in the ulxmlrpcpp
	subdirectory.

  * Regenerating Makefile.in's
	Change to the source directory and run:

	$ ./autogen.sh

	The version of the autotools to run is hard coded in the
	script, they will probably have to change over time.

  * Build a distribution
	$ cvs -d /flux/ANONCVS co ulsshxmlrpcpp
	$ mkdir ulbuild
	$ cd ulbuild
	$ ../ulsshxmlrpcpp/configure
	$ gmake dist

  * Bump version number
	Open configure.in and change the numbers passed to AC_INIT and
	AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.  Then rerun autogen.sh .
