The Master Plan (tm) for moving to our new IP subnets:

X Mail users explaining downtime

* Fix hardcoded things in datbase/files (see Leigh's mail for list)

X Set up experimental simulation on test Cisco

* Save configurations on ciscos 1 and 2

X Put Netcomm port in own VLAN, enable, set up routing in Cisco2

X Move plastic to new VLAN, change IP, route

X Move paper to new VLAN, change IP, rotue

* Move control network ports to new VLAN, reboot testbed machines

***** IP addresses to change

X Paper's .214 interface becomes .128 - Fix local routing table

X Plastic's .214 interface becomes .129 - Fix routing

* Cisco1's IP interface (becomes a .128)

* Cisco2's IP interface (becomes a .128, in VLAN 666)
	
* Cisco4's IP interface (becomes a .128)
	
* All testbed nodes become .132's (in dchp and proxydhcp config)
	
* Make changes permanent on paper/plastic
	
***** Misc things to do

X Set up the UDP helper port to forward from the control VLAN to 

* Get DNS records (forward and reverse) to agree with new setup

* Generate new SSL certificate for paper?

* Tell CS about new IPs for paper and plastic, for backup purposes (or, we
  could leave their .212 interfaces alive)

* One paper is using new address, update DNS records to use new address

***** VLANs to create

X Outside: Consists only of cable running to outside router and a fake router interface

X Private: Already exists as VLAN 666 - Add paper's interface (3/25) to this
  (Power controllers are 4/30-44 (evens)) and cisco1 (4/23) and  cisco4 (4/2)

X Public: For now, just plastic's interface (3/23) and router

X Control: All tbpcs (3/1-20,3/29-48), router, temporarily 214 net wire (4/27)

***** Some kludges to get around potential problems

* Paper and plastic should be able to keep their .212 interfaces for an
  indefine period of time
  
X Paper can get a .130 interface temporarily if the 'UDP helper' port (for
  DHCP) is problematic

***** Simple IP allocation description

* Private: 155.101.128/24

* Public: 155.101.129/24

* Control (sharks): 155.101.130/24

* Control (PCs): 155.101.132/22
