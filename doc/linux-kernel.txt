Some notes on how to build and install a new linux kernel.

1. Config the kernel with an existing .config file. Copy the file into
   the toplevel directory, and then do "make oldconfig". A lot of stuff
   will scroll by very fast. In some cases, if the modules have change,
   it will ask you questions about configuring new stuff. I just take the
   default value with a carriage return.

   You can also "cp arch/i386/defconfig .config" and then change the
   first section dealing with the CPU type from 386, to PIII. See below

2. Do a "make dep".

3. Build the kernel proper with "make".

4. Build the kernel modules with "make modules"

5. Build the compressed boot image with "make bzImage"

6. Install the modules with "su1 make modules_install"

7. Copy the kernel files into /boot with:

	su1 cp System.map /boot/System.map
	su1 cp vmlinux /boot/vmlinux-2.2.14-5.0
	su1 cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz

8. Run lilo with "su1 lilo"
