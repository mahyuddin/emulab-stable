  Log:
  Changes to permission checks for nodes, experiments, and images.
  In addition to the usual checks, project_root and group_root (in the
  project) get the same permission as if they were in the subgroups with
  group_root permission. This means they can swap/terminate/reboot etc
  in subgroups even though they are not members of the subgroups.
  There is still some copy problems with files, but leaving that till
  later to deal with.

  Log:
  Add target_pid,target_gid arguments to joinproject page so that
  we can send links that cause those fields to be filled in for people.
  Add those links to email generated by newproject and newgroup pages
  so that they can be saved by the leaders.
  
  Add a bit of referrer magic to login page. When clicked from the join
  or new project pages, tell login page to pass along the referrer page
  so that when login is complete, user is zapped back to the original
  page. This is especially nice when combined with the above change to
  joinproject, whereby we send along the target pid/gid, but the user
  has not yet logged in and remembers to do so via the link at the top
  of the page.
