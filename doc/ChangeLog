  Log:
  Changes to permission checks for nodes, experiments, and images.
  In addition to the usual checks, project_root and group_root (in the
  project) get the same permission as if they were in the subgroups with
  group_root permission. This means they can swap/terminate/reboot etc
  in subgroups even though they are not members of the subgroups.
  There is still some copy problems with files, but leaving that till
  later to deal with.
