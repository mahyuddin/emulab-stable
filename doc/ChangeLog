  Log:
  The rest of the sync server additions:
  
  * Parser: Added new tb command to set the name of the sync server:
  
  	tb-set-sync-server <node>
  
    This initializes the sync_server slot of the experiment entry to the
    *vname* of the node that should run the sync server for that
    experiment. In other words, the sync server is per-experiment, runs
    on a node in the experiment, and the user gets to chose which node
    it runs on.
  
  * tmcd and client side setup. Added new syncserver command which
    returns the name of the syncserver and whether the requesting node
    is the lucky one to run the daemon:
  
      SYNCSERVER SERVER='nodeG.syncserver.testbed.emulab.net' ISSERVER=1
  
    The name of the syncserver is written to /var/emulab/boot/syncserver
    on the nodes so that clients can easily figure out where the server
    is.
  
    Aside: The ready bits are now ignored (no DB accesses are made) for
    virtual nodes; they are forced to use the new sync server.
  
  * New os/syncd directory containing the daemon and the client. The
    daemon is pretty simple. It waits for TCP (and UDP, although that
    path is not complete yet) connections, and reads in a little
    structure that gives the name of the "barrier" to wait for, and an
    optional count of clients in the group (this would be used by the
    "master" who initializes barriers for clients). The socket is saved
    (no reply is made, so the client is blocked) until the count reaches
    zero. Then all clients are released by writting back to the
    sockets, and the sockets are closed. Obviously, the number of
    clients is limited by the numbed of FDs (open sockets), hence the
    need for a UDP variant, but that will take more work.
  
    The client has a simple command line interface:
  
      usage: emulab-sync [options]
      -n <name>         Optional barrier name; must be less than 64 bytes long
      -d                Turn on debugging
      -s server         Specify a sync server to connect to
      -p portnum        Specify a port number to connect to
      -i count          Initialize named barrier to count waiters
      -u                Use UDP instead of TCP
  
      The client figures out the server by looking for the file created
      above by libsetup (/var/emulab/boot/syncserver). If you do not
      specify a barrier "name", it uses an internal default. Yes, the
      server can handle multiple barriers (differently named of course)
      at once (non-overlapping clients obviously).
  
      Clients can wait before a barrier in "initialized." The count on
      the barrier just goes negative until someone initializes the
      barrier using the -i option, which increments the count by the
      count. Therefore, the master does not have to arrange to get there
      "first." As an example, consider a master and one client:
  
  	nodeA> /usr/local/etc/emulab/emulab-sync -n mybarrier
  	nodeB> /usr/local/etc/emulab/emulab-sync -n mybarrier -i 1
  
      Node A waits until Node B initializes the barrier (gives it a
      count).  The count is the number of *waiters*, not including the
      master. The master is also blocked until all of the waiters have
      checked in.
  
      I have not made an provision for timeouts or crashed clients. Lets
      see how it goes.

    tmcd/linux           delaysetup 
  Log:
  Here we have the Linux delaysetup startup script - first revision.  This
  uses iproute2+tc, modprobe, and iptables to setup traffic shaping.
  A few notes are warranted:
  
  1) [g]red is not yet supported
     - need to make these modules classful in the kernel first
  
  2) sysctls are used here to up the amount of buffer space available for
     sk_bufs (socket buffers).  Couldn't see a place to do this in the kernel
     config.
  
  3) Only linkdelay support is implemented
     - probably could add normal delay-node support without too much trouble.
  
  4) reverse pipe numbers are (currently) ignored
     - not needed since the IMQ device used to shape incoming traffic
       is distinct from the actual interface - no namespace collision.
  
  5) Kernel selection is similar to FBSD: check running kernel, and reboot
     if the kernel version isn't what we expect (have to rerun lilo too)

  Log:
  This commit represents the culmination of my work on linux traffic shaping.
  Both changes to the kernel, and to userland control applications are included
  in this checkin.  At present, these files are combined patches; I'll be
  separating out the Emulab specific additions/changes in the near future.
  
  The best resource (currently) for understanding the Linux traffic control
  mechanisms is at the Linux Diffserv project home page (under Documentation):
  http://diffserv.sourceforge.net/
  
  The most noteworthy contributions I've made are the PLR module and DELAY
  module port and enhancement.  These two modules are classful (though they
  don't use classification filters) and can be chained together with other
  modules such as the Heirarchical Token Bucket (used for limiting bandwith).
  See: http://luxik.cdi.cz/~devik/qos/htb/
  
  Note that this checkin also includes the patches necessary to obtain
  Intermediate Queueing Devices (IMQ) and HTB control under iproute2+tc.  The
  IMQ devices allow the attachment of qdiscs on the incoming side of a real
  interface (can't do this without them). See: http://trash.net/~kaber/imq/
  
  The Linux Advanced Routing HOWTO is another good source of information:

  Log:
  A set of changes to make swapmod work on jailed nodes (note, swapmod
  does not yet work with remove virtual nodes; that will take even more
  work).
  
  Added a new allocstate called RES_TEARDOWN. assign_wrapper no longer
  deallocates unused nodes, but rather moves them into the new state for
  the wrapper (tbswap) to deal with. Thats cause deleted vnodes need to
  be torn down, since its possible that the node on which they were
  living will not be deallocated (say, if there are other vnodes on
  it). We do not want to be doing that from assign_wrapper, so tbswap
  looks for those nodes.
  
  Made vnode_setup allocstate aware in the same way that os_setup is;
  do not reboot vnodes or try to set up vnodes when they are already in
  the RES_READY state, as they will be when doing a swapmod. In
  addition, if os_setup is going to reboot the underlying physnode, move
  the vnodes on that node into RES_READY too, since there they will
  setup automatically. Might need an interim state here, for correctness.

  Log:
  Give assign the ability to make dynamic pclasses. Here's how it works:
  After building the set of pclasses normally, we make another pass
  through the vnodes. The goal to create a pclass for each individual
  node. We disable the node's 'own' pclass to begin with. Then, the
  _first_ time it gets a vnode mapped to it, we remove it from the
  'regular' pclass it belongs to, and enable it's own pclass. Then, if
  it goes empty, we put it back in its regular pclass and disable it's
  own.
  
  The point of this is to replace -p for use with multiplexed nodes.
  Instead of disabling pclasses altogheter, which has serious
  performance implications, we can instead be smart about which pnodes
  remain equivalent (because nothing's been mapped to them), and which
  are now different. The result is that on my test topoloy, the time to
  get a good mapping has gone from over 3 minutes to about 6 seconds.
  
  This feature is enabled with the -d option, and the -P option is
  pretty much mandatory when using it, since it greatly exacerbates the
  problem of cruft in the ptop file.
  
  This satisfies #14 from the todo file:
  14.  do dynamic pclasses
  
  Also bumped up the minimum neighborhood size from 500 to 1000. In some
  tests I was doing, this resulted in better solutions.

  Log:
  Major changes to the way assign handles LAN nodes.
  
  LAN nodes are no longer treated specially. Instead, I've introduced
  the idea of 'static' types (old-style types retroactively become
  'dynamic' types). While a pnode can only satisfy one dynamic type at a
  time, it can always satisfy its static types (assuming it has enough
  capacity left.) Static types are flagged by prepending them with a '*'
  in the ptop file. So, for example, you may give switches the
  '*lan:10000' type so that they can satisfy virtual LAN nodes. Of
  course, other pnodes can have this type too, so that we can get
  'trivial LANs'.
  
  Actually, removing special treatment for LANs cleans up a lot of code.
  However, it may have some negative impacts on solutions, since we're
  not as smart about where to place LAN nodes as we used to be (they get
  annealed along with everything else, and not migrated.) I haven't seen
  any evidence of this yet, however.
  
  This leaves us with a single type of special pnode, a switch.
  
  Also added a new bit of syntax in ptop files - when '*' is given as a
  the maxiumum load for a type, the node is allowed to take on an
  infinite (well, actually, just a really big number of) vnodes of that
  type.
  
  ptopgen was modified to always report switches as being capable of
  hosting LANs, and assign_wrapper now understands direct links to LANs,
  which is what we get when the LAN is hosted directly on a switch.
  
  Fixed a bug in scoring direct links, in which the penatly was being
  added once when a direct link was mapped, but subtracted only once
  when it was freed.
  
  Added a '-T' option for doing simple self-testing. When adding a node
  to the solution, assign records the score, adds the node, removes it
  again, and checks to make sure that the resulting score is the same as
  the original score. The usefulness of this feature in debugging
  scoring problems cannot be understated...

  "posted" state so the batch daemon will see them. Swapping out a
  batchmode experiment does the expected; it puts them back into the
  Pause state. Terminating a batch mode experiment does the expected;
  its gone. When a batch mode experiment finishes normally, it goes back
  into the pause state, which allows batches to be reinjected as many
  times as Eric likes.

  Add new script to notify users when they are over their quota. Runs from

  so that it does the right thing in any installation, without any

  One possible caveat regarding quotas: If FS_NODE != USERNODE, they don't
  have a login on the fs machine. So checking their quota won't work unless
  the rpc.rquotad(8) daemon is running on FS_NODE, which we currently don't
  do.
  
  In order to do this right, I had to add a new configure var,
  FS_WITH_QUOTAS, that has a space separated list of file systems that have
  quotas enabled. (Ie the default is 'FS_WITH_QUOTAS="/q /users"'.) It
  doesn't have any default, since I couldn't come up with a reasonable one.
  All the defs files have been updated appropriately to define this new
  variable.

  Semi-major frisbee overhaul:

  Implement PREQUEST message which passes a bit map of desired blocks.
  We still use the REQUEST message (start block + number of blocks) for
  full chunk requests as that is more efficient.

  Allow dynamic number of variable-sized write buffers.  Total memory
  not to exceed the writebufmem limit.

  Eliminate a complete copy of the uncompressed data in the client.

  Fix a bug in the client where we would not keep our request-ahead window full.

  Fix a bug in the server where we would not merge incoming requests with
  the request currently being serviced.
	
  The above changes/bugfixes gave us about a 5% improvement in run time locally.

  Add some client/server convenience options.  For the server, -W allows 
  specification of a target bandwidth.  For the client, -C, -W and -M
  give various ways of specifying how much memory to use for net/disk
  buffering.

  Security: -S option tells client to only accept packets from a specific
  IP address.

  By default it only shows things that are over an idleness threshold. It
  also has a mode to show all expts. Also can show idleness/activity by node
  instead of by expt, which has a slightly different table. (s/Nodes/NodeID/)
  
  idlemail isn't finished yet, but I don't want it to hold up idletimes and
  the other changes any longer. It doesn't get used by anything yet, of
  course.

  Add "Address Line 2", City, State, and Zip as independent entities,
  finally! These have been in the DB for a long time, but never used.
  As Eric pointed out, its easier to get realistic address info from
  people if we provide the right forms. The downside is that all current
  users will have to adjust their info the next time they edit their
  info. Thats okay. I thought about forcing all users to do it the next
  time they log in, but I figured people would scream.

  Log:
  Massive reworking of our structure for defs files.
  
  Before:
  The main defs file (ie for configure) had an entry for WWWDEFS that
  pointed to a <@WWWDEFS@>-defs.php3 file in the www/ directory. The www
  defs file loaded some values about web pages, URLs, and some web
  configuration parameters.
  
  Problem:
  Anything that was only in the www defs file was not accessible in the rest
  of the universe (ie perl, C, and any other non-web-page scripts). For
  instance, you couldn't have a perl script send an email to a user with a
  link to the web site.
  
  Solution:
  Nuke all the www-defs files, move any important values into the main
  configure, and change the web defs infrastructure to respect that. This
  also meant adding about 3 lines each to all of the configure defs files.
  (There really are about 10 new values you can change in your defs file,
  but in almost all cases, the default values are the right thing.)
  
  Upgrading:
  External sites will need to move a few variables from their www-defs file
  into their configure defs file. The example file should make it pretty
  obvious. They may also want to customize some of the other vars that are
  mentioned in configure.in and www/defs.php3.in .

  Log:
  Add target_pid,target_gid arguments to joinproject page so that
  we can send links that cause those fields to be filled in for people.
  Add those links to email generated by newproject and newgroup pages
  so that they can be saved by the leaders.
  
  Add a bit of referrer magic to login page. When clicked from the join
  or new project pages, tell login page to pass along the referrer page
  so that when login is complete, user is zapped back to the original
  page. This is especially nice when combined with the above change to
  joinproject, whereby we send along the target pid/gid, but the user
  has not yet logged in and remembers to do so via the link at the top
  of the page.

  Log:
  Changes to permission checks for nodes, experiments, and images.
  In addition to the usual checks, project_root and group_root (in the
  project) get the same permission as if they were in the subgroups with
  group_root permission. This means they can swap/terminate/reboot etc
  in subgroups even though they are not members of the subgroups.
  There is still some copy problems with files, but leaving that till
  later to deal with.
