  Log:
  Add support for idleswapping an experiment as the creator of the
  experiment, rather than as an administrator, which presents group
  permission problems when the experiment is in a subgroup (requires two
  additional group, whereas suexec adds only one group). That aside, the
  correct approach is to run the swap as the creator. To do that, must
  flip to the user (from the admin person) in the backend using the new
  idleswap script, and then run the normal swapexp. Add new option to
  swapexp (-i) which changes the email slightly to make it clear that
  the experiment was idleswapped, and so that the From: is tbops not the
  user (again, to make it more clear).

    account              quotamail.in 
  Log:
  Add new script to notify users when they are over their quota. Runs from
  cron daily, on the fs node (ops) as root. Uses lots of configure variables
  so that it does the right thing in any installation, without any
  customization.
  
  One possible caveat regarding quotas: If FS_NODE != USERNODE, they don't
  have a login on the fs machine. So checking their quota won't work unless
  the rpc.rquotad(8) daemon is running on FS_NODE, which we currently don't
  do.
  
  In order to do this right, I had to add a new configure var,
  FS_WITH_QUOTAS, that has a space separated list of file systems that have
  quotas enabled. (Ie the default is 'FS_WITH_QUOTAS="/q /users"'.) It
  doesn't have any default, since I couldn't come up with a reasonable one.
  All the defs files have been updated appropriately to define this new
  variable.

  Semi-major frisbee overhaul:

  Implement PREQUEST message which passes a bit map of desired blocks.
  We still use the REQUEST message (start block + number of blocks) for
  full chunk requests as that is more efficient.

  Allow dynamic number of variable-sized write buffers.  Total memory
  not to exceed the writebufmem limit.

  Eliminate a complete copy of the uncompressed data in the client.

  Fix a bug in the client where we would not keep our request-ahead window full.

  Fix a bug in the server where we would not merge incoming requests with
  the request currently being serviced.
	
  The above changes/bugfixes gave us about a 5% improvement in run time locally.

  Add some client/server convenience options.  For the server, -W allows 
  specification of a target bandwidth.  For the client, -C, -W and -M
  give various ways of specifying how much memory to use for net/disk
  buffering.

  Security: -S option tells client to only accept packets from a specific
  IP address.

  Update Linux image to Redhat 7.3. The old image is still available to
  users by using the OSID RHL71-STD in their NS files.

  idletimes is the new commandline tool for checking idleness. It shows a

  By default it only shows things that are over an idleness threshold. It
  also has a mode to show all expts. Also can show idleness/activity by node
  instead of by expt, which has a slightly different table. (s/Nodes/NodeID/)
  
  idlemail isn't finished yet, but I don't want it to hold up idletimes and
  the other changes any longer. It doesn't get used by anything yet, of
  course.

  As Eric pointed out, its easier to get realistic address info from
  people if we provide the right forms. The downside is that all current
  users will have to adjust their info the next time they edit their
  info. Thats okay. I thought about forcing all users to do it the next
  time they log in, but I figured people would scream.

  Log:
  Massive reworking of our structure for defs files.
  
  Before:
  The main defs file (ie for configure) had an entry for WWWDEFS that
  pointed to a <@WWWDEFS@>-defs.php3 file in the www/ directory. The www
  defs file loaded some values about web pages, URLs, and some web
  configuration parameters.
  
  Problem:
  Anything that was only in the www defs file was not accessible in the rest
  of the universe (ie perl, C, and any other non-web-page scripts). For
  instance, you couldn't have a perl script send an email to a user with a
  link to the web site.
  
  Solution:
  Nuke all the www-defs files, move any important values into the main
  configure, and change the web defs infrastructure to respect that. This
  also meant adding about 3 lines each to all of the configure defs files.
  (There really are about 10 new values you can change in your defs file,
  but in almost all cases, the default values are the right thing.)
  
  Upgrading:
  External sites will need to move a few variables from their www-defs file
  into their configure defs file. The example file should make it pretty
  obvious. They may also want to customize some of the other vars that are
  mentioned in configure.in and www/defs.php3.in .

  Add target_pid,target_gid arguments to joinproject page so that
  we can send links that cause those fields to be filled in for people.
  Add those links to email generated by newproject and newgroup pages
  so that they can be saved by the leaders.
  
  Add a bit of referrer magic to login page. When clicked from the join
  or new project pages, tell login page to pass along the referrer page
  so that when login is complete, user is zapped back to the original
  page. This is especially nice when combined with the above change to
  joinproject, whereby we send along the target pid/gid, but the user
  has not yet logged in and remembers to do so via the link at the top
  of the page.

  Changes to permission checks for nodes, experiments, and images.
  In addition to the usual checks, project_root and group_root (in the
  project) get the same permission as if they were in the subgroups with
  group_root permission. This means they can swap/terminate/reboot etc
  in subgroups even though they are not members of the subgroups.
  There is still some copy problems with files, but leaving that till
  later to deal with.
