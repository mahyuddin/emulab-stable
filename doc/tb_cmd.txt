This document described the commands that are imbedded inside a ns
file to express more, testbed specific information.

Format

All TB commands are in the form:

#TB <command> <arguments>

The prefix #TB both distinguishes them from ns commands and insures
that the ns parser will ignore them (# is the comment character for
Tcl and ns).
