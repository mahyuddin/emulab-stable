This document described the commands that are imbedded inside a ns
file to express more, testbed specific information.

Format

All TB commands are in the form:

#TB <command> <arguments>

The prefix #TB both distinguishes them from ns commands and insures
that the ns parser will ignore them (# is the comment character for
Tcl and ns).


Commands

Ex.

#TB set-ip node1 198.168.0.5

This commands indicates the node <node> should be configured to have
the IP address <ip>.


#TB set-ip-interface <node> <dst> <ip>

Ex.

#TB set-ip-interface node2 node3 198.168.0.5

This commands is used to set the IP address for nodes with multiple
links.  It sets the IP for the interface the leads to <dst>.
Currently there is no support when nodes have multiple connections
between them.
