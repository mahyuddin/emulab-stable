Some notes on how to diagnose problems on the Cisco.

1. Looking at switch stats/status for a node interface.

   Mac may have a wrapper for this, but here is the guts of what you have
   to do.  To look at the switch port for a particular enet card, first
   figure out what switch port it is connected to!

      mysql tbdb
      select * from wires where node_id1='tbpcXX';

   What you care about are node_id2/card2/port2.  Node_id2 tells you which
   cisco: "cisco" is the testbed cisco (``tip test'') and "cisco2" is the
   control net cisco (``tip control'').  card2/port2 give you the info you
   need for the cisco-style card/port name (e.g., 3/39).

   Armed with this info, tip to the correct cisco, login and enable.
   Then you can do:

      show port status card/port

   or

      show port card/port

   for everything.  If, say, the port is disabled, you can do:

      set port enable card/port
