##### Configuration suggestions for testbed nodes
#####

This file contains tips we've found useful in setting up our nodes.

##### Disable PXE on non-control interfaces

Nodes will boot much quicker if you disable PXE booting (through whatever means
provided by your card) on experimental net interfaces.

##### Set power-loss behavior

Many BIOSes have an option about what to do after a power failure (which is
what it looks like to the node when it gets power cycled by a power
controller.)  They're usally 'always off', 'always on', and 'last state'.
Always on is the best - last state is OK, but if someone does a 'shutdown -h'
on the node, you can't bring it back up with power cycling - you have to go
punch the power button.  Just make sure they're not set to always off.
