Cross Compiling
---------------

These are some quick notes on cross-compiling the testbed tree for the
stargates on the garcia.  Autoconf generates some of the necessary
code for dealing with this stuff, you just need the necessary magic to
turn it on.  In this case, running the following command line on the
RHL90-XSCALE-CROSS disk image should do the trick:

  $ ../testbed/configure --host=arm-linux --build=i686-linux \
	--with-brainstem=/proj/testbed/src/brainstem

The "--host" argument tells configure what CPU/OS we want the code to
run on and the "--build" argument tells it what CPU/OS we are building
on.  Both arguments must be given for this to work.
