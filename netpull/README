netpull and tools

----------------------------------------------------------------------

netpull.tcl
	This script uses trace route to analyze a network and produce
output on the topology and RTT mean and variance.  As argument it
takes the name of a file containing a list of IP addresses.  These are
the nodes it runs trace routes to to look at the network.  Traceroutes
are run in parallel (default 4 at a time) and each address is traced
to multiple times (default 4).  

	Output is to standard out and contains two types of lines:

NODE <ip> <state>
	Indicates a node exists at <ip> and what the state of the node
is.  Either UNKNOWN, UP, or UP? .  UP? indicates that although it is
probably UP there were some problems in the trace.

LINK <src> <dst> <state> <rtt mean> <rtt variance> <rtt n> <finals>
	Indicates a link from <src> to <dst>.  <state> is OK?, DOWN,
BAD, DENIED, ERROR-#, or UP.  OK? indicates that although everything
worked traceroute reported !'s in it's output.  On
host/network/protocol errors the state is DOWN.  Routing errors result
in a state of BAD and a DENIED indicates a administrative prohibition.
Finally, UNKNOWN results with impolite hosts (see below).  ERROR-# is
ICMP unreachable codes.  <rtt mean> and <rtt variance> are the mean
and variance of the RTT, measured over <rtt n> samples.  <finals> is
the list of traceroutes (as destination IP addresses) that the link
showed up in.

	In the case of a node that does not reply to expired packets
(impolite) (* * * in traceroute) netpull assigns a bogus ip address
of 0.0.0.#.  Links to these nodes will have the state of UNKNOWN.

Options:
   -n #   - # is how many traceroutes to have running at once
   -r #   - This is how many times to trace to each IP
   -v     - If present progress information will be sent to stderr.

npdiff.tcl

	This is a script to compare two reports from npdiff.  It takes
two files as arguments and produces the following output:

NodeAppear <ip>			<ip> is in B but not A.
NodeVanish <ip>			<ip> is in A but not B.
NodeChange <ip> <old> <new>	<ip> changed from <old> to <new>
LinkAppear <src> <dst>		In B but not A.
LinkVanish <src> <dst>		In A but not B.
LinkChange <src> <dst> <old> <new>
				Link changed state.
LinkRtt <src> <dst> <diff>	RTT is <diff> off.  This is only
  displayed if the means are father apart then the variance times
  some multiple (default 4, can be changed with '-v #').  I.e. if 
  diff < A.var * mult || diff < B.var * mult

dnsconv.tcl
	This is a quick script to change large numbers of hostnames to
IP addresses.  Any hostname sent to stdin will result in the IP
address being sent to stdout.

Example:
	tclsh ./dnsconv.tcl < test > test.ip

----------------------------------------------------------------------

test
	A list of local machines for netpull demo purposes.  Use
test.ip as the argument to netpull.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

test.ip
	The 'test' file run through dnsconv.tcl.
