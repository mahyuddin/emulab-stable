This directory contains the Emulab XMLRPC client code. Lots more
information can be found at http://www.emulab.net/xmlrpcapi.php3

* sshxmlrpc_client.py: A trivial demonstration program that allows you
  to talk to the RPC server on boss.emulab.net, provided you have an
  account on Emulab. It is intended to show how to talk to the server,
  or perhaps even use it in production from the command line if you do
  not want to write your own client.

* sshxmlrpc.py: A library written at the University of Utah that you
  need to include in your Python client program. Be sure to move this
  file to your python library directory.

* emulabclient.py: Another small library that you need to put in your
  python library directory.
