## "Legacy" assign node flags - will be replaced with properties, and in some
## cases, explicit links
NodeFlagSpec =
    ## Specify that this node is a subnode of another node. We MIGHT
    ## try to do this with properties in the future
    ## Valid for both virtual and physical nodes
    element node_subnode_of { text }?,
    ## Indicates that this node should never be considered identical to any
    ## other node. Could be done with a property
    ## Valid only for physical nodes
    element node_unique { empty }?,
    ## Indicates that virtual links must either all be trivial (loopback), or
    ## none of them must be. Possibly expressible with properties?
    element node_disallow_trivial_mix { empty }?

## "Legacy" link flags used by assign. Will be replaced by properties
LinkFlagSpec = 
    ## Indicates that it is not okay to use a delay node to artificially
    ## shape/delay traffic for this link. Replace by using type system.
    element link_nodelay { empty }?,
    ## Indicates whether it is okay to multiplex this link with other virtual
    ## links onto the same physical link (old name: emulated) Probably replace
    ## by using the type system (ie. have an 'Ethernet' type that can only
    ## hold one slot,  and an 'Ethernet-tagged' type that can hold more).
    element link_multiplex_ok { empty }?,
    ## Indicates whether it is okay to satisfy this link with a trivial
    ## (loopback) link. Replace using type system.
    element link_trivial_ok { empty }?,
    ## Gives the name of the interface that must be used to satisfy the source
    ## of this link - note that the interface name is given, not the node name
    element link_fixsrciface { string }?,
    ## Same as fixsrciface, for destination of the link
    element link_fixdstiface { string }?

## Specify a virtual class - assign allows you to define classes for virtual
## nodes, and specify that all nodes using that class should, or must, be
## assigned to physical nodes of the same type
VclassSpec = element vtop_vclass {
    ## Name of the virtual class
    attribute name { text },
    ## Specify whether the vclass is hard (ie. all nodes *must* be of the same
    ## type) or soft (ie. violating it is allowed, but penalize)
    (element hard { empty } |
     (element soft { empty },
      element weight { xsd:float { minInclusive = "0.0" } } )),

## The path to which a link has been mapped
## For the moment only 2 interface mappings are specified because
## every link only has 2 interfaces for the moment.
