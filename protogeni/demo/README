The demo for the flash ProtoGENI client consists of three basic
parts.

test.fla is the base flash file which contains the basic structure and
  art assets of the demo.
src/*.as is the set of classes which implement the demo
src/com/mattism/http/xmlrpc/* is the xmlrpc library which has been
  modified to act as the network channel.

-----
Build
-----

The only way to build the flash demo is with the flash authoring tool. Start the flash authoring tool and open test.fla. Select File -> Publish.

test.swf will be created in the same directory as test.fla.

------------------
Basic Architecture
------------------

The demo is organized at a fundamental level as a set of menus only
one of which is active at any time. Main.as contains the basic
functionality to select and move between menus. MenuSliceSelect,
MenuSliceCreate, and MenuSliceDetail provide the implementations for
the three menus.

The canvas which is used to manage and modify a slice is
MenuSliceDetail. It delegates the work to three different objects: an
ActiveNodes object which manages the nodes and links between them, a
ComponentManager object which maintains the combo box and selection
list for nodes, and a Console which executes any xmlrpc calls needed
and update the console text box.
