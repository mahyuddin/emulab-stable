Development
=========== 
FlashBuilder is not required, but recommended.  Below are directions for using either Adobe's commercial IDE Flash Builder or the freely available FLEX SDK commandline tools.

Flash Builder
------------
Version: Any (last used as of this documentation is 4.7)
Flex SDK: >= 4.6 (copy to the flash builder's SDK folder and add to the installed SDKs in the Flash Builder section of preferences). Note that Adobe donated Flex to Apache, so you must get the most recent SDK from Apache Flex (currently 4.8.0 as of this documentation).  If you use Apache Flex and wish to use Flash Builder, it is recommended (required?) to use Flash Builder 4.7.

You should be able to copy the flack directory into a FlashBuilder workspace and import it as a project.

Ensure:
- In the run configurations, make sure it launches 'js\flack.html' instead of the default .swf
- In the project preferences: under 'Flex Compiler':
 * >= 4.6 SDK is selected
 * 'generate HTML wrapper' is unselected
- In the project preferences: under 'Flex Build Path':
 * Output directory is 'js'
 * Framework linkage is 'merged into code'

FLEX SDK only
-------------
You should be able to use the included build.xml with the freely available Flex SDK >= 4.6 to generage a flack.swf which you can copy into the js/ directory and run the flack.html.
