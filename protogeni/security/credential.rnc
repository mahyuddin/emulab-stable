# ProtoGENI credential and capability specification. The key points:
#
# * A credential is a set of capabilities or a Ticket, each with a flag
#   to indicate delegation is permitted.
# * A credential is signed and the signature included in the body of the
#   document.
# * To support delegation, a credential will include its parent, and that
#   blob will be signed. So, there will be multiple signatures in the
#   document, each with a reference to the credential it signs.
