The schemata described in $testbed_srcdir/protogeni/updates differ from
the running databases. As a safety measure, you will not be able to
install until this is resolved.

If you are a user of the emulab software outside of Utah, this is
probably because your database was created for an older version of the
emulab software. You can update your database by:

	boss> cd /your/srcdir/protogeni/updates
	boss> sudo perl $objdir/scripts/update
