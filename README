This is a snapshot of the current source code for the software that runs
Netbed (Emulab++) at the University of Utah:

NOTE: See the file RESTRICTED-RIGHTS for restrictions on this interim
snapshot.  In summary, for now you can't redistribute it or use it for
commercial purposes.


HOW TO
Copy and localize the 'defs-default' file for your environment
and run ./configure.

This is a snapshot, not a formal distribution, so don't expect
great documentation.  See the files in the 'doc' directory.
To get started, see doc/setup*.
