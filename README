This is a snapshot of the current source code for the software that runs
Netbed (Emulab++) at the University of Utah:
   http://www.emulab.net/

NOTE: See the file RESTRICTED-RIGHTS for restrictions on this interim
snapshot.  In summary, for now you can't redistribute it or use it for
commercial purposes.

HOW TO
Copy and localize the 'defs-default' file for your environment
and run ./configure.

DOCUMENTATION
This is a snapshot, not a formal distribution, so don't expect
great documentation.

doc/* contains documentation for developers.
www/*.html and www/doc/*.html contain end-user documentation.
(www/faq.html will be especially valuable to those unfamiliar with the system.)

QUICK TOUR
 - The Database maintains most testbed state.
   - LibDB (db/libdb.pm.in) is the main DB interface for testbed software.
   - sql/database-create.sql contains the DB schema.
   
 - The Web Interface (www/*) is the primary means of managing the system.   

 - startexp (tbsetup/startexp.in) is the backend for experiment creation;
   Important scripts it calls include tbprerun (tbsetup/tbprerun.in) 
   and tbswap (tbsetup/tbswap.in).

 - ns2ir (tbsetup/ns2ir/*) converts NS files to DB state (via TCL). 
 - assign (assign/*) maps experiments to available hardware.
 - snmpit (tbsetup/snmpit.in) configures VLANs on switch hardware.
 - frisbee (os/frisbee.redux/*) uses multicast to rapidly deploy disk images.
 - tmcd (tmcd/*) is contacted by nodes as they boot up, to get configuration.
 - capture and console (capture/*, tip/*) provide serial line access to nodes.
