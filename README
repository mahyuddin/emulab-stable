This is a snapshot of the current source code for the software that runs
Netbed (Emulab++) at the University of Utah, as well as testbeds at other
sites:
   http://www.emulab.net/

This is a snapshot of a rapidly-evolving system, rather than an engineered
release. It contains all Netbed source required to build a running testbed, but
interaction with Utah will almost certainly be required to get things up and
running.

Netbed is being actively developed, so there will be features on deployed
Netbeds that are not included in this snapshot. Contact us (contact info at the
bottom of this file) if you are interested in receiving an updated version of
this source.

NOTE: See the file RESTRICTED-RIGHTS for restrictions on this interim
snapshot.  In summary, for now you can't redistribute it or use it for
commercial purposes.

HOW TO
Copy and localize the 'defs-example' file for your environment
and run ./configure - see doc/setup.txt for details.

DOCUMENTATION
This is a snapshot, not a formal distribution, so don't expect
great documentation.

doc/* contains documentation for developers.
www/*.html and www/doc/*.html contain end-user documentation.

Good places to start would include:
  - The user tutorial (www/tutorial/tutorial.html)
  - The user FAQ (www/faq.html)
  - The user authorization document (www/auth.html)
  - The software architecture notes (doc/arch.txt and doc/arch-diagram.ps)
  - The overview of some major systems (doc/overview.txt)
  - Diagrams and brief explanations of the state machines used in the 
    system (www/doc/states.html and www/doc/*.gif)
  - The instructions for making a running system (doc/setup*.txt)

QUICK TOUR
 - The Database maintains most testbed state.
   - LibDB (db/libdb.pm.in) is the main DB interface for testbed software.
   - sql/database-create.sql contains the DB schema.
   
 - The Web Interface (www/*) is the primary means of managing the system.   

 - startexp (tbsetup/startexp.in) is the backend for experiment creation;
   Important scripts it calls include tbprerun (tbsetup/tbprerun.in) 
   and tbswap (tbsetup/tbswap.in).

 - ns2ir (tbsetup/ns2ir/*) converts NS files to DB state (via TCL). 
 - assign (assign/*) maps experiments to available hardware.
 - snmpit (tbsetup/snmpit.in) configures VLANs on switch hardware.
 - frisbee (os/frisbee.redux/*) uses multicast to rapidly deploy disk images.
 - tmcd (tmcd/*) is contacted by nodes as they boot up, to get configuration.
 - capture and console (capture/*, tip/*) provide serial line access to nodes.
