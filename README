Welcome to Emulab!

This is the "official" source code for the software that runs the Emulab
network testbed at the University of Utah, as well as dozens of testbeds at
other sites around the world. 

   http://www.emulab.net/

This is a snapshot of a rapidly-evolving system.  It contains all Emulab
source required to build a running testbed, but interaction with Emulab
admins at Utah and elsewhere will likely be required to get things up
and running.

Emulab is being actively developed, so there may be features in deployed
Emulabs (in particular, Utah's) that are not included in this release.
Emulab is also a research project, and is rapidly evolving to satisfy the
needs of both our research needs and external researchers. For that reason,
you might find bugs! We hope you will tell us about them (nicely) and maybe
even help us to fix them. More on this below.

HOW TO SETUP AN EMULAB
The Emulab installation documentation is located on the Utah Emulab Wiki:
 https://users.emulab.net/trac/emulab/wiki/InstallRoot
 
HOW TO UPDATE AN EMULAB
Updating your existing Emulab is a bit harder than a fresh install, but is
mostly automated. A process that we hope will work for most sites is
located on the Utah Emulab Wiki:
 http://users.emulab.net/trac/emulab/wiki/InstallRoot
under "Upgrade Documentation".

TRACKING THE EMULAB SOURCE CODE
We encourage you to track the Emulab source code in real time and stay
current with our stable versions More info on how to access the
Emulab source code repository is here:

MAILING LISTS
If you are bringing up an Emulab, be sure to join the mailing list:
    emulab-admins@googlegroups.com
    http://groups.google.com/group/emulab-admins
which has open archives.

Users of your Emulab should join the Emulab users groups, which is intended
for all users of Emulabs anywhere, to help each:
    emulab-users@googlegroups.com
    http://groups.google.com/group/emulab-uses

HELP/CONTACT INFORMATION
For help and to report bugs and problems, mail to
   emulab-admins@googlegroups.com

Don't be shy! In most cases, you will have the same questions other people
have. Search the archives too! There is lots of good information there.

LICENSE
See the file AGPL-COPYING for licensing conditions.  In summary, the

DOCUMENTATION
All of the Emulab documentation is available from the Utah Emulab site:

We encourage people to help us improve our documentation. If you want to
make changes, please apply for an account at Utah; anyone with an account

QUICK TOUR
 - The Database maintains most testbed state. 
   * Assorted modules (db/*.pm.in) are the main DB interface for testbed
     software.
   * sql/database-create.sql contains the DB schema.
   
 - The Web Interface (www/*) is the primary means of managing and
   interfacing with the system. There is also an experimental
   standalone GUI that uses this interface.

 - The tbsetup and backend directories contain the bulk of the server-side
   experiment setup and management code.
   * startexp (tbsetup/startexp.in) is the backend for experiment creation;
     Important scripts it calls include tbprerun (tbsetup/tbprerun.in) 
     and tbswap (tbsetup/tbswap.in).
   * ns2ir (tbsetup/ns2ir/*) converts NS files to DB state (via TCL and XML).
   * snmpit (tbsetup/snmpit.in) configures VLANs on switch hardware.

 - assign (assign/*) maps experiments to available hardware.

 - The frisbee subsystem (os/frisbee.redux, os/imagezip) is used for creation
   and rapid deployment of disk images.

 - The client-driven node configuration is handled by scripts on the client
   which communicate with the server via a custom configuration protocol.
   The server- and client-side of this mechanism is in the tmcd subdir.

 - capture and console (capture/*, tip/*) provide serial line access to nodes.

 - dynamic node and experiment control is provided via the Emulab event
   system and its assorted agents (event/*).
