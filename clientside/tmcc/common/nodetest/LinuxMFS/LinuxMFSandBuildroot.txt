Hi Dan,

(Sorry for the delay - I spaced this yesterday after we talked.)

I have a 'buildroot' environment setup that you can use to build
executables for our Linux MFS if you wish.  Here are the salient bits:

Machine: highlander.onelinux.testbed.emulab.net (pc313 -
testbed/onelinux experiment)
Path: /mnt/local/buildroot-2012.08

Documentation:

http://buildroot.uclibc.org/downloads/manual/manual.html

Note particularly the section on "Building out of the tree", which is
what I've done in the directories "br-build1" and "br-build2" in
/mnt/local.  This will keep the buildroot source there relatively
clean.  Feel free to copy the configuration I've got there in
"br-build2" as a starting point.

Section "5.3.1" on "Using the generated toolchain outside of
buildroot" may be particularly relevant assuming you don't want to
create a buildroot-specific package (Makefile) for what you're doing.
I actually have a buildroot toolchain compiled and installed in
/opt/br-toolchain that will probably "just work" for cross-compiling
to x86/uclibc for use with the Linux MFS.

Let me know if you run into problems or have questions.
