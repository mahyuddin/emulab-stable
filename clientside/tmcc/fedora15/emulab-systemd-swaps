# This is a hack to avoid Emulab and systemd conflicts.  Basically, sometimes
# our MFSes add swap devices to /etc/fstab that are incorrect (i.e., /dev/hda 
# instead of /dev/sda).  We could always add 'noauto' to the mount options so 
# systemd would ignore it, but we have legacy or deployed MFSes to deal with.
# When systemd encounters one of these, it tries to start the device and halts
# the boot process for a long time while waiting for the device to "start".
#
# We can't edit the bogus /etc/fstab entry before system reads it, because 
# because system reads it while the root is still mounted read-only, very early
# on in the startup process.
#
# systemd doesn't allow us to remove units (a swap device is a unit, just like 
# a service is a unit), so all we can do is, before the swap unit runs, cancel
# any pending systemd jobs before they try to initialize the the bogus device(s).
