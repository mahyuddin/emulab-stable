# HACK: run dhclient on all interfaces, and do nothing else
# (well, now also bring up a widearea node control net statically if asked)
#
# Note that this file's name (eth99) cannot overlap with an actual
# existing interface or dhclient will loop.  dhclient-script invokes
# the source-config function which sources the ifcfg-ethN file.  Thus
# if this script were called "ifcfg-eth0" and eth0 was the DHCPable
# interface, we would wind up recursively invoking dhclient (trust me,
# I tried it :-)
#
# Now we actually invoke this from /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-emulabcnet,
# not directly from here, since /etc/init.d/network stop sources this file
# without telling it why it was sourced.  So, we define a custom ifup script
# instead, triggered by the DEVICETYPE variable being set to emulabcnet, 
# and by creating /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-emulabcnet.
