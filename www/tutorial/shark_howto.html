<h1>Emulab - Sharks - HOWTO</h1>
</center>

<p>There are a large number of sharks available for use in Testbed
experiments.  Unfortunately, the sharks are greatly limited in their
topology.  Sharks can only be used in groups of up to 8, connected to
each other via a 10Mb, no delay, no loss LAN, with a single link to
the rest of the topology.

<p>To use sharks in your experiment just set them up as normal nodes.
Use <code>tb-set-hardware</code> to set them to type
<code>shark</code> and make sure their topology adheres to the
conditions below.

<p>Any deviation from these conditions will result in an error.

<ul>
  <li>Any LAN containing sharks must be 10 MB, 0 latency, no loss.
  <li>At most 8 sharks per LAN.
  <li>No non-sharks directly in any LAN containing sharks.
  <li>At most one link to any LAN containing sharks.
  <li>No shark outside of a LAN.
  <li>No shark with any links.
</ul>

<p>Example:

<pre>
source tb_compat.tcl

set ns [new Simulator]

set s1 [$ns node]
set s2 [$ns node]
set s3 [$ns node]
set s4 [$ns node]
set n1 [$ns node]

tb-set-hardware $s1 shark
tb-set-hardware $s2 shark
tb-set-hardware $s3 shark
tb-set-hardware $s4 shark

set slan [$ns make-lan "$s1 $s2 $s3 $s4" 10Mb 0ms]

tb-set-ip-lan $s1 $slan 1.2.3.100
tb-set-ip-lan $s2 $slan 1.2.3.101

$ns duplex-link $slan $n1 100Mb .5ms DropTail

$ns run
</pre>

<p>Note especially that <code>n1</code> is not in the LAN but linked
to it.
