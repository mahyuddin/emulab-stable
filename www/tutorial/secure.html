<a NAME="Overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Originally, the goal of an Emulab experiment was to provide an isolated
environment in which to run tests.  Isolation here primarily meant resource
isolation--preventing artifacts in an experiment due to other experiments or
outside influences.  While basic authentication and protection mechanisms
were used, the threat model being addressed was accidental "attacks" on
isolation; e.g., a misconfigured interface causing flooding of another
experiment's network.
We are now building up the Emulab infrastructure to allow experimentation
with more potent threats, in particular ''malware'', which attempts to
actively exploit weaknesses on nodes and in the network.
</p><p>
Since Emulab is intended for use by researchers, we did not unnecessarily
want to restrict access from the Internet to experimental nodes and visa-versa.
Thus the central Emulab firewall is fairly permissive.  For high-risk
experiments, this is not acceptable.  To address this, we have added
<a href="docwrapper.php3?docname=firewall.html">per-experiment control net
firewalls</a>.
</p><p>
Another decision made early on, for the convenience of users, was for extensive
use of shared infrastructure such as a shared filesystem and a central login
machine within Emulab allowing for efficient control of experiments.  Such
shared infrastructure provides an easy target for malware, so through the
use of <a href="elabinelab.php3">''Emulab in Emulab''</a>
we provide per-experiment Emulab infrastructure.
</p><p>
By combining the two facilities, we enable containment of high-risk experiments
without sacrificing the features that make Emulab so easy to use.
