<a NAME="Overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Emulab allows the ability to setup a
<a href="docwrapper.php3?docname=tutorial.html#ControlNet">control-network</a>
firewall between an experiment and the outside world.
This is <b>not</b> a firewall
between nodes within an experiment, that is, the firewall is not part of
your NS-specified network topology.
The purpose of an Emulab firewall is to prevent experimental traffic from
escaping, via the control network, to the Internet due to a mis-configured
application or router within an experiment.  Control net firewalls are also
a key component of Emulab ``high-security'' experiment environments.
</p><p>
The firewall is implemented by allocating an additional node to the experiment.
Through switch-enforced VLANs, the experiment is given its own private
control network connecting all nodes in the experiment.  Network traffic
between experiment nodes and any hosts outside the experiment (Emulab
infrastructure or Internet hosts in general) must pass through the firewall
node.  The firewall is setup as a filtering layer2 bridge using IPFW2
on FreeBSD and can be configured in a number
of ways to block or allow certain types of traffic.
</p>
<p>
<a NAME="Swapin"></a><h3>Swapin actions</h3>
When a firewalled experiment is swapped in, the firewall is setup and
activated before any experiment nodes are allowed to setup.  Currently
this adds approximately five more minutes to swapin time, as the firewall
node must first be loaded with the FBSD-IPFW2 disk image.
</p>
<a NAME="Swapout"></a><h3>Swapout actions</h3>
<p>
When a firewalled experiment is swapped out, extra precautions are taken
to ensure that the nodes are decontaminated before the firewall is taken
down.  The nodes, including the firewall itself, are scheduled to boot into
a network-loaded, memory-based version of FreeBSD (the "MFS") which will run
a script to zero all the known bootblocks on the disk.  This prevents a node
from accidentally booting from its disk prior to being reloaded.
</p><p>
The "boot to MFS" process is done not by issuing a reboot command or even by
doing a power cycle, but rather by simultaneously powering off all nodes
and then later powering them back on.  Reboot is not used since the reboot
command could be spoofed on a contaminated node.  Power cycling is not used
since cycling is normally performed in batches to avoid network (or power)
overload on restart.  Skewed reboots like this open a window of vulnerability
where nodes rebooted later might be able, before they are rebooted, to spoof
the reload server for nodes that have just rebooted.
So we first turn everyone off so that later batched power-ons are safe.
</p><p>
Only when all nodes are known to be running in the MFS and their disks
neutered, will the nodes be released to the reloading experiment.
Any failure in the above process results in all nodes for the experiment
being left powered off, with the control net disabled, and marked as "paniced"
so that only a testbed admin can swap it out.
</p>
<a NAME="Use"></a><h2>Use</h2>
<p>
To add a firewall to an Emulab experiment, you specify a Firewall object
in your NS file (there is currently no way to add a firewall via the Emulab
client or experiment creation GUI):
	<code><pre>
	set fw [new Firewall $ns]
	$fw set-type &lt;type&gt;
	$fw set-style &lt;style&gt;
	</code></pre>
This tells Emulab to add a node called "fw" to your experiment, and provides
a handle for adding rules to the firewall.
The "type" of the firewall should be <code>ipfw2-vlan</code>.
Another type, <code>ipfw</code>, <a href="#YeOleImpl">has been deprecated</a>
and should not be used.
In the future, there may be additional types for different firewall
implementations (e.g., Linux with ipchains).
The "style" of the firewall is one of:
<a NAME="Styles"></a>
<ul>
<li><code>open</code>: A completely open firewall allowing all traffic.
This gives you a hook for setting up custom firewall rules (below).
<li><code>closed</code>: A closed firewall allowing no communication with
the outside world or other experiments within Emulab.
Nodes can still communicate in a limited fashion with
the Emulab infrastructure.
<li><code>basic</code>: A mostly closed firewall allowing only <code>ssh</code>
connections from the outside world, and <code>HTTP/HTTPS</code> connections
from inside (primarily for Windows Update on Windows XP nodes).
</ul>
The firewall can be augmented with user-specified rules as well:
	<code><pre>
	$fw add-rule &lt;IPFW format rule string&gt;
	</code></pre>
In the basic form, rules are numbered starting at 100.  Thus, rules are
interpreted in the firewall in the order in which they appear in the NS file.
The default rules for a firewall style have numbers either less than 100
or greater than 60000, so
user-specified rules are interpreted ahead of all but the most important
default rules.
There is also a method allowing explicit numbering of rules:
	<code><pre>
	$fw add-numbered-rule &lt;ruleno&gt; &lt;IPFW format rule string&gt;
	</code></pre>
allowing more precise control over their interpretation and allowing for
linked rules.  A <a href="#Example">complete example</a> is shown below.
</p><p>
It should be noted that user-specified rules will only apply to IP traffic
passing through the firewall.  Non-IP traffic is not allowed through the
firewall, and traffic to the firewall node itself is controlled by a different
set of rules which cannot be overridden with this mechanism.
For example, in a closed firewall that does not allow <code>ssh</code>,
you can add a rule to allow <code>ssh</code> access from a particular machine
to one of the firewalled nodes, but not to allow access to the firewall
itself.
</p>
<a NAME="Limitations"></a><h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
One should note carefully the following issues.
<ul>
<li><b>The firewall is just another node in the topology</b>.
It is setup just like all other nodes, this includes enabling accounts
and NFS access.  Thus anyone who can login to a node, can login to the
firewall.  This is not as bad as it may sound since the firewall node is
subject to its own rules.
Thus, in all but the open firewall style, the firewall node rejects all
packets sent to it from the inside, and in the closed firewall, it rejects
all traffic from the outside as well.
However, even with the firewall rules,
the nodes and the firewall do share common filesystems in /users and /proj.
In the future, firewalls will have much more constrained access.
<li><b>The firewall must run FreeBSD with IPFW</b>.
However, this is not fundamental to the design and we hope that the
firewall syntax will be general enough to support at least Linux with
ipchains as well.
<li><b>The firewall rule syntax is fixed</b>.
In particular, it allows only fixed strings with no form of per-user
or per-experiment variable substitution.
There is a limited form of substitution used to plug in Emulab-wide
parameters such as the Utah control network subnet.
Since IPFW allows hostnames, you can at least
use symbolic host names
(i.e., the node names you use in your NS file)
in place of IP addresses in your rules.
<li><b>Firewall setup is static</b>.
Rules are specified in the NS file at experiment creation time.
Rules can be changed using experiment modify, or by logging into the firewall
and changing rules by hand with IPFW.
A more dynamic interface may be desirable,
in particular integration with the event system.
On the other hand, it is not necessarily
a good thing to have a firewall that is too easy to (mis)configure.
<li><b>There is always a firewall for experiments</b>.
Keep in mind that Emulab has an external firewall already which imposes
some site-wide restrictions (yes, there should be a link here...)
So just allowing some ports through your experimental firewall doesn't
guarantee that the affected traffic will make it to the outside world.
</ul>
</p>
<a NAME="KnownBugs"></a><h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<p>
There is a mighty fine line between a "limitation" and a "bug".
But this one probably crosses the line:
<ul>
<li><b>The firewall exposes more of the infrastructure than it should</b>.
The Emulab node self-configuration and monitoring infrastructure uses a
lot of different services on the boss and ops nodes.  At the current time,
we allow all those through.  Moreover, many of these, such as TFTP, cannot
be pinned down too precisely in firewall rules, so the rules are more open
than we would prefer.  Additionally, we also currently preserve the shared
filesystem access model inside firewalled experiments, which permits not
only attacks on NFS but allows for trojans to be placed in the filesystems.
</ul>

</p>
<a NAME="Example"></a><h2>A Complete Example</h2>
<p>
Here is the NS code for a simple two node experiment with a firewall:
	<code><pre>
	source tb_compat.tcl
	set ns [new Simulator]

	set n1 [$ns node]
	tb-set-node-os $n1 FBSD-STD
	set n2 [$ns node]
	tb-set-node-os $n2 RHL-STD
	set link [$ns duplex-link $n1 $n2 100Mb 0ms DropTail]

	# create a firewall node
	set fw [new Firewall $ns]
	$fw set-type ipfw2-vlan
	$fw set-style closed

	# allow traceroute through
	$fw add-rule "allow udp from EMULAB_CNET to any 33434-33524"
	$fw add-rule "allow udp from any 33434-33524 to EMULAB_CNET"

	# and ssh sessions from "users" to one of the nodes
	$fw add-rule "allow tcp from users.emulab.net to n1 setup keep-state"

	$ns run
	</code></pre>
<code>EMULAB_CNET</code> is an example of the limited variable replacement
capability.  In the Utah case, it expands to "155.98.36/22".  Note that
even though this rule names the entire control net space of all experiments,
it effects only those nodes within this experiment since the firewall is
per-experiment.
The last <code>add-rule</code> invocation demonstrates using a symbolic
node name, "n1", to reference the node identified by the object "$n1"
in the NS file.  This rule also takes advantage of the dynamic rule capability
in IPFW2.  The rule itself only allows through TCP packets in the "setup"
state (SYN but no ACK), but instructs IPFW to construct a limited lifetime
dynamic rule allowing bidirectional traffic between the source and destination
IP addresses and TCP ports from the packet.
</p><p>
This NS specification yields a topology that looks like:
<br>
<img src="firewall-experiment.png" alt="&lt;Three nodes, two connected&gt;">
<br>
No surprises.  Two nodes connected by a link, with a "disconnected" firewall
off to the side.
What isn't shown is that all three are connected via the control net.
The firewall is accessible via a DNS name of
<code>fw</code>.<i>experiment</i>.<i>project</i>.<code>emulab.net</code>
similarly to
other nodes.
You can login to the firewall (if allowed by the rules),
reboot it, etc. just as any other node.
The <code>Experiment Details</code> web page for the experiment lists
all the rules for the firewall:

</code></pre>
The rules from 10 to 79 are for the firewall itself, from 80 to 65534 are
for bridged ("layer2") packets, i.e., those that pass through the firewall.
As user rules start at 100, 
Again, notice the rules with <code>EMULAB_</code> variables.  <code>NS</code>
is the Emulab name server IP address, <code>CNET</code> the control network
subnet, <code>MCADDR</code> and <code>MCPORT</code>, the multicast addresses
and ports used by the Frisbee disk loader.  Other rules involving the hosts
<code>boss</code>, <code>ops</code>, <code>fs</code>, <code>ntp1</code>,
and <code>ntp2</code>, are Emulab infrastructure related.
</p>
<a NAME="YeOleImpl"></a><h2>The deprecated <code>ipfw</code> firewall</h2>
<p>
An earlier, less secure, firewall implementation did not require support
from the switching infrastructure.  This "software" firewall solution
still allocated an extra node to act as an IP firewall.
This node was then set as the default route for all other nodes in the
experiment.  Thus, all outgoing, non-experimental traffic was passed through
the firewall node.  Inbound traffic directed to the nodes did not pass through the firewall.
So in addition to <a href="#Limitations">the limitations above</a>
you can add the following for this deprecated version:
<ul>
<li><b>The firewall was implemented using OS-provided routing</b>.
Specifically, every node has its default route changed to point to the
firewall node.  Sufficiently powerful applications could accidentally
or intentionally change the default route back to the Emulab router,
thus circumventing all protection.
<li><b>Intra-Emulab traffic was not firewalled</b>.
Traffic between nodes over the control net
(155.98.36.x addresses) is not filtered since the shared control net is a LAN
and all other nodes are directly reachable.
Additionally, traffic between the nodes and the Emulab
infrastructure (boss and ops) does not pass through the firewall.  Host
routes are explicitly setup to avoid the firewall.
</ul>
</p>
