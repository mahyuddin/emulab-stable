<h1>Loghole - Emulab Log Management Utility</h1>
</center>

The <b>loghole</b> utility downloads log files from certain directories on the
experimental nodes (e.g. "/local/logs") to the Emulab users machine.  After
downloading, it can also be used to produce and manage archives of the log
files.  Using this utility to manage an experiment's log files is encouraged
because it will transfer the logs in a network-friendly manner and is already
integrated with the rest of Emulab.  For example, any programs executed using
the Emulab event-system will have their standard output/error automatically
placed in the "/local/logs" directory.  The tool can also be used to preserve
multiple trials of an experiment by producing and managing zip archives of the
logs.

You can learn more about the <b>loghole</b> utility by reading its man page on
<i>users.emulab.net</i>.
