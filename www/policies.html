<h1>Administrative Policies</h1>
</center>

Most any legitimate research/experimental use is allowed, including
use by companies.  Of course, when demand exceeds supply we will have
to assign priorities to projects, but the hardware base will be expanding.

<h2>Acceptable Use, Allocation Priority, Reporting, Governance, Disclaimer</h2>

Our current and anticipated policies follow.  We expect these to
evolve as experience demands, and we are open to constructive
suggestions concerning them.

<h3>Acceptable Use</h3>
In principle, almost any research or experimental use of the testbed
by experimenters that have a need for it is appropriate.
<p>
"Abuse" of the facility or its other users, in any form, will of course
result in termination of access.  Abuse includes using the facility
for other than a project's stated purpose.

<h3>Allocation Priority</h3>

When the testbed become oversubscribed we will be allocating its
resources based on some function-- currently vague but in roughly
this order-- of
perceived research value and broader impact,
the testbed's uniqueness as a suitable platform for the research,
novelty as a testbed application,
resources required (typically: number of nodes),
experimenters' contribution to testbed software development,
experimenters' lack of access to other appropriate facilities,
sponsorship by our primary sponsors (currently NSF and Cisco),
educational value,
affiliation with an academic institution,
whether the project is funded/peer-reviewed,
and for commercial users, their willingness to help defray costs, i.e., pay.
<p>

Many development-oriented commercial experiments and evaluations will
be allowed, but low priority.


<h3>Reporting</h3>

In order to assess the testbed's impact and report to our sponsors, we
simply require notice of all publications or patents to which the testbed
contributed.  Formal acknowledgement in such publications is required
as well. Something like the following:

<blockquote>
"We blah blah blah ... 
emulab.net, the Utah Network Emulation Testbed,
which is primarily supported by NSF grant ANI-00-82493 and Cisco Systems."
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, we will be soliciting feedback and suggestions from
our users.

<h3>Governance</h3>

An administrative board, including representatives from our major
sponsors, will be involved in setting broad policy and have review
authority.  Typically, a small executive committee composed of members
from the University of Utah Flux research group will decide most
resource allocation issues.
<p>
A Technical Advisory Board is also being formed, containing distinguished
members of the network and distributed systems research communities.

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

We are providing broad access to the testbed in the hopes that it will
be useful, but we do so WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
<p>

We disclaim all liability from errors in results or security breaches
resulting from emulab's use.  The system has been in production use for
over a year, but is constantly undergoing rapid development, so
significant amounts of code are always new.
We make an effort to provide inter-project security, but users
must realize that high security is unlikely in i) such a new and rapidly
evolving system, ii) where users have such complete control over
hardware and software resources, and iii) in such a public facility
that will attract attack.
