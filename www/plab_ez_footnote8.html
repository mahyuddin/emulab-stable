	We will select PlanetLab nodes for your slice using the following
	criteria:
	<ul>
	    <li><b>Load average</b> - We consider the load average of each
	        PlanetLab node, and attempt to find the least-loaded nodes for
		you. The resource estimates on the advanced form are used to
		determine if each node has the resources necessary to run
		your experiment.  We always exclude PlanetLab nodes that have
		extremely high load averages.</li>
	    <li><b>Sites</b> - We will attempt to spread your nodes over as
	        many distinct sites as possible.</li>
	    <li><b>Up</b> - We only consider PlanetLab nodes that appear to be
	        up and responding to sliver creation requests.</li>
	    <li><b>Disk space</b> - We only consider PlanetLab nodes that have
		at least 5% of their disk space free, so that your experiment
		will have some room to write local files.</li>
<!-- Replace with text about direct NM access when it exists.
	    <li><b>dslice</b> - At the moment, we only have authority to create
	    	slivers on nodes running the dslice service, which is a subset
		of all PlanetLab nodes.</li>
-->
	</ul>
	<p>The 'All available nodes' and 'One node at each site' buttons 
	(on the 'More options' page) will attempt to get you as many nodes as
	possible given the above criteria. These buttons can be used in
	conjunction with the type selection box below to select all nodes of a
	particular type.</p>

	<p>You can get other node selection policies, such as picking some (or
	all) nodes yourself or requesting specific end-to-end link
	characteristics, by creating an NS file and uploading it through the
	'Advanced Experiment' page.</p>
