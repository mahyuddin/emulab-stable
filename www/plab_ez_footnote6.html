	If checked, this will put your slice into our batch queue. We assign
	nodes based on available resources such as load average and disk
	space - if not enough nodes are available with sufficient resources
	for your experiment, slice creation will normally fail. If you check
	this box, our batch queue will keep trying to instantiate your slice
	until enough resources are available. When your slice has been
	created, you will receive e-mail.
