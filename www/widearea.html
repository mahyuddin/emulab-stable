<h1>
    Wide-area Nodes
</h1>
</center>

Emulab's wide-area effort includes 50+ (and growing) PCs scattered
around world at more than 30 sites, connected via commodity internet,
internet2, DSL and cable modem. Researchers wishing to run experiments
on the "real" internet can request permission to use the wide-area
nodes. Similar to experiments using just local Emulab nodes, you can
setup network overlays and automated traffic generation. However,
certain policies and restrictions are in place, so please review these
in case your needs conflict.

<ul>

<li> All access to wide-area nodes is via ssh. There are no passwords stored
     on wide-area nodes so you must upload your public keys via
     Emulab's web interface, and use an authentication agent to
     forward your private keys.

<li> Access is currently non-root, without the ability to spoof or
     sniff traffic.

<li> No non-congestion controlled flows, no big transfers
     unless pre-cleared or during really off hours, and no contact
     between the wide-area nodes and unapproved external nodes (i.e. no
     pinging or tracerouting to all points on the globe).  We haven't
     had any problems with external researchers on the nodes we've
     opened up thus far, including a cable modem, but we'll keep
     a very careful eye on it.  

<li> Several of the nodes (nc-cable, mediaone-ma, and msanders) are on
     residential low bandwidth links. No high bandwidth flows except
     during off (late night) hours.

<li> No hacking attempts of the wide-area nodes or external nodes!

<li> No sending mail from the wide-area nodes.

<li> No processes may run with elevated priority without prior
     permission.  If permission is granted, nodes may run at up
     to nice -3.  In no event may users processes use realtime
     scheduling, or any other scheduling mechanism that can block
     the system for an extensive amount of time.

<li> Remember, the nodes are a shared resource.  Please do not
     spin-wait for extended periods of time.  (If possible, do not
     spin-wait at all!).  The testbed nodes run with a 1ms scheduling
     granularity, so operations such as <tt>nanosleep</tt> are
     surprisingly effective.

</ul>

Emulab's wide-area nodes are comprised of nodes setup by Emulab sites,
as well as nodes from the MIT Testbed (also called the RON Cluster).
