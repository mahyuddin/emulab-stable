<h1>
    Wide-area Nodes
</h1>
</center>

The MIT Testbed (also called the RON Cluster) has recently been added
to Emulab's wide-area effort. There are currently 30+ PCs scattered
around world, connected via commodity internet, internet2, DSL and
cable modem. Researchers wishing to run experiments on the "real"
internet can request permission to use the wide-area nodes. Similar to
experiments using just local Emulab nodes, you can setup network
overlays and automated traffic generation. However, certain policies
and restrictions are in place, so please review these in case your
needs conflict.

<ul>

<li> All access to wide-area nodes is via ssh. There are no passwords stored
     on wide-area nodes so you must upload your public keys via
     Emulab's web interface, and use an authentication agent to
     forward your private keys.

<li> Access is currently non-root, without the ability to spoof or
     sniff traffic.

<li> No non-congestion controlled flows, no big transfers
     unless pre-cleared or during really off hours, and no contact
     between the wide-area nodes and unapproved external nodes (i.e. no
     pinging or tracerouting to all points on the globe).  We haven't
     had any problems with external researchers on the nodes we've
     opened up thus far, including a cable modem, but we'll keep
     a very careful eye on it.  

<li> Several of the nodes (nc-cable, mediaone-ma, and msanders) are on
     residential low bandwidth links. No high bandwidth flows except
     during off (late night) hours.

<li> No hacking attempts of the wide-area nodes or external nodes!

<li> No sending mail from the wide-area nodes.

</ul>
