So, here is my list of things to do. No particular order. Relative
importance should be obvious. Whoever does this work *will* program in the
dominate style of the existing, newly written, 4500 lines of code! Now, if
I could just figure out how to add a php mode to emacs ...

* Add DB connect as authorized user so we can track whats going in
  the DB log files.

* Add password hint for the clueless users who forget their passwords.

* Put a limit on the number of new users/projects that can be
  unapproved (to prevent DOS attacks on the database).

* Run arguments through addslashes to quote special characters since
  things like ' in strings mess up database insertion. 
  
* Decouple root privs from begin experiment privs, as per Jay
  request. Default on for begin experiment, default off for root.

* Add verification for when the user wants to change the email address
  through user mod page, to ensure the email is valid.

* Minor bells and whistles and formatting changes. Or maybe I mean fancy
  things up a tiny bit. I tend to be a minimalist (my favorite example is
  the google search page compared to the Lycos or netscape page), but my
  stuff is probably too minimal.

* Admin pages. Continue to add the admin modes to various pages, or create
  a new set of admin only pages. I prefer admin modes in existing pages.

* Continue on the authentication stuff as per Dave's original suggestion of
  certificates. I'm not too crazy about this unless its easy to do all of it
  on my home machine (apache server).

* More linking of information in the forms. There are some obvious places
  where stuff should be presented as hypertext links so that navigation is
  easier.

* Backup links in all the pages.

* Admin page to remove a project.

* Admin page to remove a user.

* Admin page to remove an experiment.

* Add confirm buttons in various places. I did one in the end experiments
  page, as a simple button (so you gotta press two things). I think this
  appproach is fine.

* Fix case sensitivity problems in project, user, and experiment names.
  That is, anyplace a user *types* in a username, project name, or an
  experiment name, downcase it. Mac was going to do this, but I don't know
  if he got to it. 

* Lastly, macrofy the entire thing and get rid the damn frames! I hate
  frames!
