    <h1>Welcome to Testbed Control</h1>

    <h2>What is the Testbed?</h2>

    The Testbed is a large scale (225 node) testbed for research in
    networking and distributed systems, with externally configurable
    control over all its physical characteristics and software. Put
    another way, the Testbed is an "Internet in a Room" that can be
    fully controlled and operated via its Web interfaces.
    <p>

    <h2>Who is it for?</h2>

    Researchers working in traditional areas of networking;
    active/programmable networking and services; distributed systems;
    fault tolerance and high availability; distributed simulation;
    security, including denial-of-service resistance and intrusion
    detection; epidemic quorum and gossip protocols; parallel and
    distributed I/O architectures; "active disk'' I/O architectures;
    performance projection of postulated hardware; and for
    computational loads: measurement, analysis, tuning, task
    assignment and scheduling, and relationship to hardware and
    software characteristics.

    <h2>What can it do?</h2>

    The Testbed allows an experimenter to do accurate emulation of
    wide area networks via user-configurable control of the Testbed's
    ``physical'' characteristics, such as error models, latency,
    bandwidth, packet ordering, processing power, and buffer space.
    Low-level device/OS costs such as interrupt load and memory
    bandwidth can be captured. Experimentation on the router software
    itself, as well as ease of maintainence and robust security, is
    provided by fully user-replaceable router OS/software;
    
    <h2>How do I get started</h2>

    Briefly, you use the links at your left to create and join
    <em>projects</em>. Typically, a project leader will request
    permission from Testbed Control, via the web interface, to
    <em>create</em> a project.  Then, people working on project
    (students, staff, etc.) will request permission from the Project
    Leader, also via the web interface, to <em>join</em> the project.
    Once project members have been authorized, they can log onto the
    Testbed interface to start an experiment, reserving and
    configuring nodes as necessary. More detailed information on this
    process can be found in the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    There is an extensive <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> which will
    hopefully answer any other questions you have regarding the
    Testbed.
