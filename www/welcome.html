    <h1>Testbed Control</h1>

This is the operational Web interface to the testbed.
For information on the testbed itself, see the
<a href = "http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/testbed/">base</a> and
<a href = "http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/testbed/doc/">documentation</a> pages.
<p>

Use this set of pages
<ul>
<li> to gain authorization to use the testbed, either as
	<ul>
	<li> a project leader ("principal investigator" in academic
		parlance) starting a new project ("start project"), or
	<li> as a worker bee in a particular project ("join project");
	</ul>
<li> as a project leader, to approve or deny pending project members;
<li> to authenticate ("login") to the Web-based testbed services.
</ul>
<p>

When your project or membership request is approved or denied you will
receive email.


    <h2>How do I get started</h2>

    Briefly, you use the links at your left to create and join
    <em>projects</em>. Typically, a project leader will request
    permission from Testbed Control, via the web interface, to
    <em>create</em> a project.  Then, people working on project
    (students, staff, etc.) will request permission from the Project
    Leader, also via the web interface, to <em>join</em> the project.
    Once project members have been authorized, they can log onto the
    Testbed interface to start an experiment, reserving and
    configuring nodes as necessary. More detailed information on this
    process can be found in the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    There is an extensive <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> which will
    hopefully answer other questions you have regarding the
    Testbed.
