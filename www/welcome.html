<h1>Emulab Home</h1>

<p>
Welcome to Emulab. Emulab (sometimes called the Utah Network Testbed)
is a new and unique type of experimental environment: a
universally-available "Internet in a room" which will provide a new,
much anticipated balance between control and realism. Several hundred
PCs, combined with secure, user-friendly web-based tools, allow you
to remotely reserve, configure and control machines and links down to
the hardware level: error models, latency, bandwidth, packet ordering,
buffer space all can be user-defined. Even the operating system disk
contents can be securely and fully replaced with custom images.

<p>
The Testbed currently features high-speed Cisco switches connecting,
with over 2 miles of cabling, 160 end nodes and 40 core nodes. The
core nodes can be used as end nodes, simulated routers or
traffic-shaping nodes, or traffic generators. During an experiment's
time slots, the experiment (and associated researchers) get exclusive
use of the assigned machines, including root access if desired.  Until
we finish designing and building smarter scheduling and state-saving
software, and obtain the disk space, scheduling is manual and done at
coarse granularity (days).

<p>
We provide some default software (e.g. Linux and FreeBSD on the PCs,
NetBSD on the Sharks) that many users may want. The basic software
configuration on your nodes includes accounts for project members,
root access, DNS service, compilers and linkers. But fundamentally,
the software you run on it, including all bits on the disks, is
replaceable and up to you.  The same applies to the network's
characteristics, including its topology: configurable by users.
