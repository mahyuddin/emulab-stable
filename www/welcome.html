    <h1>Testbed Operations</h1>

This is the Web-based operational interface to the testbed.
For information on the testbed itself, see the

OUTLINE

Policy

Authorization Scheme

What is it?
	Raw hardware and management and configuration tools.
	In practice, provide some default software that many users
	may want.  But fundamentally, the software you run on it,
	including all bits on the disks, is up to you.

What do users get?
	Home dir on login node.



<h2>Overview of the authorization scheme and policy</h2>

<h2>Policy</h2>

<ul><b>Appropriate Use:</b>
In principle, almost any research or experimental use of the testbed
by experimenters that have a need for it is appropriate.
<p>

When our resources become oversubscribed we will be allocating
resources based on some currently vague function of perceived research
value, resources required (typically number of nodes and weirdness
 of software), the testbed's uniqueness as a suitable platform for the
research,

sponsorship by our primary sponsors (currently NSF and Cisco),
affiliation with an academic institution, funded project,
and for commercial users, ability to pay.



Many commercial users would also be allowed




Use this set of pages
<ul>
<li> to gain authorization to use the testbed, either as
	<ul>
	<li> a project leader ("principal investigator" in academic
		parlance) starting a new project ("start project"), or
	<li> as a worker bee in a particular project ("join project");
	</ul>
<li> as a project leader, to approve or deny pending project members;
<li> to authenticate ("login") to the Web-based testbed services.
</ul>
<p>

When your project or membership request is approved or denied you will
receive email.


    <h2>How do I get started</h2>

    Briefly, you use the links at your left to create and join
    <em>projects</em>. Typically, a project leader will request
    permission from Testbed Ops, via the web interface, to
    <em>create</em> a project.  Then, people working on project
    (students, staff, etc.) will request permission from the Project
    Leader, also via the web interface, to <em>join</em> the project.
    Once project members have been authorized, they can log onto the
    Testbed interface to start an experiment, reserving and
    configuring nodes as necessary. More detailed information on this
    process can be found in the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.

    <h2>How to contact Testbed Ops</h2>

    For questions or problems, send email to
    <a href="mailto:testbed-ops@flux.cs.utah.edu">
