    Software Overview

</center>

<ul>
<li><b>boss.emulab.net</b>: Master server, database, web server, name server, trusted disk-image server
    <p>
    Runs FreeBSD 6.2.  This is the master machine for the testbed
    software.  Runs all the critical software components and thus is not
    directly accessible by testbed users.  Mediates (via the database)
    access to node power cycling and disk-image loading as well as providing
    DNS and web services.

<p>
<li><b>users.emulab.net</b>:  NFS and SFS file server,
    login/control/console access point, serial line server.

    <p>
    Also known as <b>ops.emulab.net</b> and <b>fs.emulab.net</b>.
    Currently runs FreeBSD 6.2.  This is the main server machine for users
    of the testbed and is where shared home directories and all project files
    live.  While most of the testbed configuration process is done via
    the Web interface, a few things must be done while logged into
    users.emulab.net.  These testbed specific commands and programs are
    contained in <code>/usr/testbed/bin</code>. Your skeleton login
    files already have this directory in your path.

<p>
<li><b>pc[001-XXX]</b>: Each Emulab has a variety of testnodes that
       are available to users. Please see the 
       <a href="hardware.html">hardware page</a> for a
       complete description of available hardware types. In general,
       all testbed nodes run a variety of operating systems including
       FreeBSD, Redhat Linux, Fedora Core, and even
       <a href="doc/docwrapper.php3?docname=windows.html">
       Windows&nbsp;XP</a>. Registered users can find out exactly what
       operating systems are supported on each node type by clicking
       on <a href="https://www.emulab.net/showosid_list.php3">List
       OSIDs</a> in the Emulab web interface "Experimentation" drop
       down menu.
       
       <p>
       You can also run whatever OS you like by loading

       image</a>.
