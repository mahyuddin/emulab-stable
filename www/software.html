    Software Overview

<ul>
<li><b>users.emulab.net</b>: Control node, NFS server, serial line server
    <p>
    Runs FreeBSD 4.3-RELEASE.  This is the main server machine for
    the testbed and is where home directories and all project files
    live. While most of the Testbed configuration process is done via
    the Web interface, a few things must be done while logged into
    users.emulab.net. These Testbed specific commands and programs are
    contained in <code>/usr/testbed/bin</code>. Your skeleton login
    files will already have this directory in your path.
    
    <p>
    This is also our serial line server, which allows experimentors to
    access the console port of each node in their experiment.

<p>
<li><b>pc[1-40].emulab.net</b>: Testbed PC nodes
    <p>
    The testbed nodes dual boot FreeBSD 4.3 and RedHat Linux 7.1. You
    may also boot your own OSKit kernels on them. Alternatively, you
    can run whatever OS you like by loading your own OS image onto the
    the 4th DOS slice using the Testbed configuration software.

    <p>
    Each node has 5 100/MBbps ethernet cards. The first four
    interfaces are connected to the "experimental network," and are
    used to "wire up" your specific network topology. The last
    interface is connected to the "control network," and is used
    for configuration and for login access from users.emulab.net. In
    FreeBSD this card is named `fxp4', and in Linux it is `eth0'.

    <p>
    All of the Testbed PCs have their COM1 serial interface (console
    port) connected to users.emulab.net. The port is configured to run
    at 115K baud, and are accessible from users.emulab.net (via the
    tip command) using the appropriate "pc" names; e.g., "pc6."

<p>
<li><b>sh[1-20]-[1-8].emulab.net</b>: Testbed Shark nodes
    <p>
    The Sharks NetBSD by default, with the filesystems provided via
    NFS. You may also boot your own OSKit kernels. At this time, no support
    is provided for running your own operating system on the Sharks.

    <p>
    Each Shark has a single 10Mbps ethernet which serves as both the control
    and experimental interface. This is done with IP "aliasing", and
    causes experimental traffic to be routed to the experimental
    network instead of the control network.

    <p>
    All nodes use the serial port as their console, but due to the
    limited number of serial ports on the control node, only the last
    Shark on each shelf is connected to the control node.  These
    designated Shark console lines are accessible from
    users.emulab.net (via the tip command) using the appropriate
    "tbsh" shelf names; e.g., "sh16."

</ul>
