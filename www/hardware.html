<ul>
<li>40 PC nodes (<b>tbpc01-40</b>), consisting of:

<ul>
<li> 600MHz Intel Pentium III "Coppermine" processors.
<li> 
<a
href="http://www.asus.com/Products/Motherboard/Pentiumpro/P3b-f/index.html">
Asus P3B-F (6 PCI/1 ISA slot)</a> motherboard (old reliable BX chipset).
<li> 128MB PC100 ECC SDRAM.
<li> 5 Intel EtherExpress Pro/100B 10/100Mbps Ethernet cards.
<li> <a href="http://www.storage.ibm.com/hardsoft/diskdrdl/desk/ds34gxp.htm">
13GB IBM 34GXP DPTA-371360 7200RPM IDE</a> hard drive.
<li> Floppy drive
<li> Cheap video card (Jaton Riva 128ZX AGP w/4MB video RAM)
<li> All in a nice but overweight rackmount case on rails:
<a href = "http://www.antec-inc.com/product/cases/en_rack.html">
Antec IPC3480B</a>, with 300W PS and extra fan.
</ul>
<p>

<li>160 <a href = "http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/iag/">
	Compaq DNARD "Sharks"</a> as edge nodes.  233 Mhz StrongARM processors,
	32M memory, 10Mbps ethernet, diskless.
	Runs NetBSD and custom kernels (OSKit, etc.)
<p>


<li> a server (<b>users.emulab.net</b>), consisting of:

<ul>
<li> Dual 500MHz Intel Pentium III cpus
<li> <a href="http://developer.intel.com/design/servers/l440gx/index.htm">
Intel L440GX+</a> motherboard (the GX+ chipset)
<li> 512MB PC100 ECC SDRAM
<li> 90 GB disk space: 5 
<a href="http://www.quantum.com/products/hdd/atlas_iv/atlas_iv_overview.htm">
Quantum Atlas IV 18GB 7200RPM Wide LVD SCSI</a> hard drives
<li>64 port
<a href="http://www.cyclades.com/dat-z.html">
Cyclades-Ze PCI Multiport Serial Board</a>
<br><em>Soon</em> 64 more ports.
</ul>
<p>

<li> 3 <a href = "http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/si/casi/ca6000/prodlit/c6000_ds.htm">
Cisco 6509 high-end switches</a>.  Two function as the "testbed backplane," each filled with a
	<a href = "http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/si/casi/ca6000/prodlit/6nam_ds.htm">
	Network Analysis Module</a>
	and seven 48-port 10/100 ethernet modules,
	giving 336 100Mbps ethernet ports on each.
	The third 6509 functions as the core router for the testbed and
	is configured with an assortment of router hardware
	and software, Gigabit ethernet, OC-12 ATM (~600Mbps), and more 
	10/100 Ethernet ports.  A fourth 6509 provides expansion room.
        <!-- Another, but no pix: http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/pcat/ca6000.htm -->
<p>

<li>10 APC MasterSwitch AP9210 8 port power controllers.<br>
    (The AP9210 is discontinued; replaced in the product line by the
    <a href="http://www.apc.com/products/masterswitch/index.cfm">AP9211</a>.)
<p>

<li>10 <a href = "http://www.wrightline.com/products/freestnd.htm">
Wrightline "Tech I" racks</a>: 44U, 34" deep, 8 are  19" wide, 2 are
	24" with cable management.<br>
<p>

</ul>

<p><h2>Layout</h2><p>

The first 4 ethernet ports of each PC node are connected to one of the
      big Cisco switches.  
All 160 ports can be connected in arbitrary ways by setting up VLANs
on the switches by using <a href = "snmpit.html">snmpit</a>.
Cisco 6500 Switch backplane bandwidth is supposed to be near 50Gb/s.
<!-- but we've heard rumors that it's worse. -->
<p>

The fifth ethernet port is connected to another Cisco 6509. They
      each have full duplex 100Mbps connections. These are for dumping 
      data off of the nodes and such, without interfering with
      the experimental interfaces. The only impact on the node is
      processor and disk use, and bandwidth on the PCI bus.

<p>

The DNARD Sharks are also attached to the big Cisco switch by way of a 
      8+2 10/100 ethernet switch from Asante. Each shelf of 8 sharks
      is capable of generating up to 80Mbps, and shares one
      100Mbps link to the Cisco.
