    <h1>Utah&nbsp;Network&nbsp;Testbed<br>Web&nbsp;Interface&nbsp;FAQ</h1>
    
    Welcome to the Utah Network Testbed. We hope to make your
    experience with us very positive, and hope that you will return,
    and recommend the testbed to others.
    <p>

    Our goal is to make the testbed very easy to use, yet flexible
    enough to do whatever you need it to do. This web interface will
    allow you to enter the appropriate data that we need to be able to
    help you better.
    <p>

    To protect any data you submit, SSL is used to encrypt data as it
    is transfered accross the Internet. Therefore, you will need to
    access these pages with a browser that supports SSL. We recommend
    Netscape 4.0 or greater, and we also recommend a screen resolution
    of at least 800x600 to avoid excessive scrolling.
    <p>

    <li><h3>So why do I need to use these web pages, anyway?</h3>
    <p>We need to get some information from you, both for security, 
      and for management of Testbed resources. These web pages
      will let you apply for an account to be able to use the
      testbed, and will let you perform management operations
      within your accounts limits.
    </p>
    
    <li><h3>What do I need to do to be able to use the Testbed?</h3>
    <p>If you're here on your own, or you're the leader of a group
      of people who want to use the Testbed, the first step is to
      apply to <em>create</em> a <em>project</em>. A project is an
      entity that has been approved to use the Testbed, and the
      project leader is held responsible for the actions of members of
      his/her project. The leader can allow users to join the project
      and use the Testbed as a member of his/her project.  To create a
      project, click on the link in the side bar titled 'Apply to
      Start a Project'. Fill out the requested information, and your
      request will be submitted to the Testbed Approval Committee.
    </p>
    
    <li><h3>Someone told me to join their project. How do I do
      that?</h3>
    <p>The process of joining an existing project is quite
      simple. Go to the 'Apply to Join a Project' page, fill out the
      form, and wait for the project leader to approve you. Once
      approved, you can log into the Testbed. Your project leader will
      control how much access you have to Testbed resources, within
      the limits given to the project as a whole.
    </p>
    
    <li><h3>I'm already a Testbed user, but I'm collaborating with
      another project. How can I join that project too?</h3>
    <p>Go back to the 'Apply for Project Membership' page, put in
      your username and password, and the project you want to join. We
      already have everything else on file. Then submit the request,
      and the leader of the project you want to join will be notified.
      If the leader approves you, you will become a member of that
      project as well.
    </p>
    
    <li><h3>I've been approved. How do I use my account?</h3>
    <p>The first step would be to come back here and log in. That
      will update list of options in the side bar. You might be
      authorized to start projects or experiments, or maybe just to
      use the nodes in an experiment. Either way, your options will
      show up in the side bar. If someone in your project starts a
      new project or experiment, they'll need to add you to it if they want
      you in it. Once they do that, they can tell you what nodes are
      reserved for the experiment, and your unix account on those
      nodes will be automatically created, and you will be able to
      use ssh to log into those machines. You will also receive an
      account on the "control" machine, and will be able to log into the
      machines via the serial line console.
    </p>
    
    <li><h3>You still haven't answered my question. Who can I
      ask?</h3>
    <p>You can try the other web pages for the Testbed, located on the
      <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/testbed/"> Testbed
	Homepage</a>, or in the
	<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/testbed/doc/"> Testbed 
	Documentation</a>. When all else fails, you can send e-mail
	<a href="mailto:testbed-control@flux.cs.utah.edu">
        Testbed Control (testbed-control@flux.cs.utah.edu)</a>.
    </p>
