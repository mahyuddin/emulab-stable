<li><h3>What do I need to do to be able to use the Testbed?</h3>
<p>
If you're here on your own, or you're the leader of a group
of people who want to use the Testbed, the first step is to
apply to <em>create</em> a <em>project</em>. A project is an
entity that has been approved to use the Testbed, and the
project leader is held responsible for the actions of members of
his/her project. The leader can allow users to join the project
and use the Testbed as a member of his/her project.  To create a
project, click on the link in the side bar titled 'Start a
Project'. Fill out the requested information, and your request
will be submitted to the Testbed Approval Committee. 
</p>

<li><h3>Someone told me to join their project. How do I do  that?</h3>
<p>
Go to the 'Join a Project' page, fill out the
form, and wait for the project leader to approve you.  When
approved you will receive an email message saying so,
and you can then log into the Testbed.
<!--  Not implemented:
	Your project leader will
	control how much access you have to Testbed resources, within
	the limits given to the project as a whole.
-->
</p>

<li><h3>I'm already a Testbed user, but I'm collaborating with
  another project.  Can I join that project too?</h3>
<p>
Yes, if that project leader approves you.  
Do the appropriate stuff on the 'Join a Project' page.
</p>

<li><h3>I've been approved.  How do I use my account?</h3>
<p>
The first step would be to come back here and log in to the Web
interface.  That will update the list of options in the side bar.
<!-- We don't support this fine granularity now.  I hope.
	You might be authorized to start projects or experiments, or
	maybe just to use the nodes in an experiment. Either way, your
	options will show up in the side bar.
-->
Those will normally include starting a new "experiment" which leads to
reserving a set of nodes, which leads to automatic creation of Unix
accounts on those nodes for all members in your project. You will be
able to use ssh to log into those machines.
<p>
You will also receive an account on the master control machine
"login.emulab.net", and from there will be able to access the test
nodes' serial line consoles via 'tip' as well as access console log
files.
</p>

<li><h3>You still haven't answered my question. Who can I ask?</h3>
<p>
You can try the other web pages for the Testbed, located on the
<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/testbed/">Testbed
Homepage</a>, or in the
<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/testbed/doc/"> Testbed 
Documentation</a>. When all else fails, you may
<a href="mailto:testbed-ops@flux.cs.utah.edu">
send e-mail to Testbed Ops</a>(testbed-ops@flux.cs.utah.edu).
