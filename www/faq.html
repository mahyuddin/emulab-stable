<li><a NAME="GS-Eligible"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Who is Eligible to use Emulab.Net?</b></font>
    <p>
    In principle, almost any research or educational use
    by those that have a need for it is appropriate and encouraged.
    This includes use by universities, industrial research labs, and both
    US and non-US institutions.   With some provisos, use for development
    and evaluation is also acceptable, even by companies.
    See our <a href ="docwrapper.php3?docname=policies.html">posted policies</a>
    for more detail.  If you are unsure about your eligibility to use
    Netbed/Emulab, please just send us an email inquiry.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="GS-1"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>How do I start a project?</b></font>
    <p>
    If you are new to the Testbed, simply click on the "Start Project"
    link on the Emulab <a href="http://www.emulab.net">Home
    Page</a>. You will need to fill in the forms with your personal
    information and information about the project. Then click on the
    "Submit" button. Within a few days you will be contacted via email
    with an approval message. More information about starting projects
    can be found in <a href="docwrapper.php3?docname=auth.html">
    Authorization Page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you already have an Emulab account, and wish to start a second
    project, first log into the Web Interface. Then select the "Start
    Project" link; all of the personal information will already be
    filled in. You will need to complete just the project information
    section. 
    </p>

<li><a NAME="GS-2"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>How do I join a project?</b></font>
    <p>
    If you are new to the Testbed, simply click on the "Join Project"
    link on the Emulab <a href="http://www.emulab.net">Home
    Page</a>. You will need to fill in the form with your personal
    information, and provide the name of the project you are trying to
    join (typically, the <i>Project Leader</i> will have told you the
    name of the project). Then click on the "Submit" button, and wait
    for an email with your new user key. When that email arrives, use
    the link in it (or the key itself), and use it with your password 
    to log into the web site and verify your account. Then just wait
    for the project leader to approve you.  When approved you will
    receive an email message saying so, and you can then log into the
    Testbed.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="GS-2b"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>I'm a project leader, 
    and someone applied to join my project,
    but they're not on the list to be approved.</b></font>    
    <p>
      Joining a project has 3 stages. The first two are done by
      the person trying to join, and they both must be completed
      before you can approve their application. The first two are
      outlined <a href="#GS-2">in the previous question</a>, where the
      user fills out the "Join Project" form, and performs account
      verification. After these two steps are both complete, the
      project leader and any group leaders in the group 
      (<a href="#GS-6">More info here</a>) will get an email saying
      the account is ready to be approved, and it will appear on the
      list of new users waiting to be approved.
    <p>
      If someone says they've applied, but you haven't received an
      email from Emulab about it, and they don't show up on your
      list, the most likely cause is that they haven't finished the
      verification step.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="GS-2c"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Will Emulab send me email messages?</b></font>
    <p>
      Yes! Emulab uses email notifications to you in several different
      ways. Often it will send you a copy of information regarding
      experiments you set up, applications to projects, and other
      things you do at Emulab. Sometimes (like with account
      verification) the email is a critical part of being able to use
      Emulab.
    <p>
      For those reasons it is <b>critical</b> that any spam filtering
      software you have accept email from Emulab itself (anything
      coming from the emulab.net domain) and from Emulab staff (from
      the cs.utah.edu or flux.utah.edu domains). In many cases, it may
      also say that is from a specific machine in those domains. Our
      messages usually do not get flagged as spam by most filters, but
      in certain cases it can be a problem. It is also important that
      it not require manual intervention or confirmation to get emails
      through to you, so programs like SpamKiller can cause problems.
    <p>
      It is also important to read your email often while you are
      using Emulab, especially while you have machines reserved in 
      an experiment. A few emails may be the only notification you'll
      get before we swap out an experiment that appears to be idle,
      and if you don't respond, you may lose important work. Email is
      also our method for informing you about problems we may be
      experiencing, downtimes, or other important announcements. Your
      experience with Emulab (and ours with you) will be much more
      pleasant if everyone is responsive to email.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="GS-3"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>I have an Emulab account. Now what?</b></font>
    <p>
    Once you have been approved to start (or join) your first project,
    you will be able to log into Emulab's user machine,
    <b>users.emulab.net</b>. We require that all Emulab users use ssh. For
    example, if your Emulab account name is "joe", then you would do:
    <pre>
	ssh users.emulab.net -l joe		</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    Your password is the same as the password you supplied to the
    Start (or Join) Project web page.

<li><a NAME="GS-PATH"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Do I need any 
    special directories in my PATH variable?</b></font>
    <p>
    There are several useful (although not required) programs installed on
    <tt>users.emulab.net</tt> in <tt>/usr/testbed/bin</tt>. You should edit
    your dot files to include that directory in your search path. 
    </p>

<li><a NAME="GS-4"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Can I be in more than one project?</b></font>
    <p>
    Yes. You may join (and/or start) as many projects as you like,
    subject to Emulab <a href="docwrapper.php3?docname=policies.html">
    administrative policies</a>.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="GS-5"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Can I change my Emulab password?</b></font>
    <p>
    Yes. You can change your Emulab Web password and your Emulab login
    password (the password you use to log into <b>users.emulab.net</b>, as
    well as nodes in your experiments). To change your password,
    simply click on the "Update User Information" in the menu to your
    left, and then enter your new password in the location provided.
    Your new password will be installed on <b>users.emulab.net</b>
    immediately. Your experimental nodes will get the new password
    when they reboot.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="GS-6"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>I'm a project leader. Can I designate TAs?</b></font>
    <p>
    Yes. To designate a TA, you must first create a project
    <em>group</em>. A project group is a lot like a unix group, and
    in fact unix groups is the mechanism used to protect members of
    one group from members of another group. When you create a group,
    you designate a <em>group leader</em> who is responsible for
    approving users who apply to join the group. Group leaders may
    also terminate experiments that have been created by members of
    the group. As Project Leader, you may also shift members of your
    project in and out of your project's groups as you like, and you
    are automatically a member of all groups within your project. As a
    convenience, all new projects are created with one new group,
    termed the <em>default group</em>. As its name implies, whenever
    the group is left unspecified in a form, it defaults to the
    project group (this allows you to create a project without any sub
    groups at all; new members join the default group, new experiments
    are created in the default group, etc.).
    </p>

    <p>
    Project groups are created via the Project Information link at
    your left. Simply go to the project page in which you want to
    create a group, and look for the "Create New Group" link. More
    information on project groups is available via the <a
    href="doc.php3">Emulab Documentation</a> page in the
    <a href="docwrapper.php3?docname=groups.html">Groups Tutorial</a>.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="GS-7a"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>How do I report a specific problem?</b></font>
    <p>
    Don't hesitate to send us <a href="emailus.php3">email</a>!
    <p>
    Ok, hesitate just a little and read the rest of this entry first.
    Before sending email, be sure to check out the
    <a href="#TR">Troubleshooting</a>
    entry which describes several common problems and possible causes.
    If you do send email, there are several pieces of information you
    should include to make our job easier.
    <ul>
    <li> The affected <b>project and experiment name</b> is pretty obvious,
    but some people forget.
    <li> The particular <b>nodes, OSes, and programs</b>
    involved will help us zero in on the problem more quickly.
    <li> The <b>time</b> at which the problem occurred.
    We need this to correlate with our various log files.
    <li> Any <b>relevant observations and actions</b> you have attempted.
    Did the problem only happen once?  Is it reproducible?  Did restarting
    a program or rebooting a node help?
    </ul>
    After sending email,
    <em>please do not swap or terminate the experiment</em>, if possible.
    It can be a lot harder to track down a problem after the experiment
    is gone.  Sometime you may need to terminate it, for example it is
    in the middle of the night our time and you really need the nodes
    that are tied up in the experiment.  But at least give us 15 minutes
    to respond to your message before acting, and then let us know that
    you did swap/terminate it.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="GS-7"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Where do I get more help?</b></font>
    <p>
    If you cannot find an answer to your question in the
    <a href="doc.php3">Emulab Documentation</a>, then you can
    send us an <a href="emailus.php3">email message</a>. We will try
    to answer your question as quickly as we can.

<a NAME="UTT"></a>
<font size='+1'><b>Using the Testbed</b></font>
<ul>
<li><a NAME="UTT-1"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Is there a tutorial?</b></font>
    <p>
    Yes, we have an extensive <a href="tutorial/tutorial.php3">tutorial</a>
    on using the Testbed.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="UTT-NETBUILD"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Do you have a GUI to 
    help me create experiments?</b></font>
    <p>
    Yes, we provide a GUI that gives you an easy to use drawing
    palette on which you can place nodes, lans, and links. Testbed
    specific attributes such as operating system, hardware type, and
    link/lan characteristics, may be attached to each object. With a
    single click, you can instantiate your new topology on the Testbed
    as an experiment in one of your projects. Alternatively, you can
    save the auto-generated NS file on your machine, edit as required,
    and then submit it later when creating an experiment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To access the GUI, please log in and go to the Begin Experiment page.
    <em>Note: you need a Java compliant browser.</em>
    </p>

<li><a NAME="UTT-TOPO"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Are there any constraints on my topology?</b></font>
    <p>
    Yes, but only those imposed by the physical hardware that is
    currently available in our testbed. The constraints that people
    most commonly run into are the maximum speed of our links
    (100Mbps) and the maximum number of network interface cards (NICs)
    in our machines. You can't get any links faster than 100Mbps,
    since we don't yet have gigabit links for experimenters to
    use. Our nodes each have 4 experimental network interfaces, so
    each node can be a member of up to 4 links or LANs. A good
    strategy for making your topology fit within those limits is to
    replace multiple links to a node with a LAN or with a router
    node. Ask Testbed Operations if you need further assistance.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="UTT-NODES"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>How many nodes can I ask for?</b></font>
    <p>
    You can ask for as many nodes as are currently available! You can
    click on the "Node Reservation Status" link at your left to see
    how many nodes are currently free. If you ask for more than are
    currently available, your experiment will be rejected (you
    will receive email notification shortly after you submit your NS
    file to the web interface).
    </p>

    <p>
    <em>We urge all new Emulab users to begin with a small 3-4 node
    experiment so that you will become familiar with NS syntax and the
    practical aspects of Emulab operation.</em>
    </p>

<li><a NAME="UTT-HOWLONG"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>How long can I keep using my nodes?</b></font>
    <p>
    You can keep them as long as you need them, subject to our <a
    href="docwrapper.php3?docname=swapping.html">Node Usage
    Policies</a>.  In general, you should do your work, and then
    terminate your experiment as soon as you're done with it. If
    you're not done with it, but are through for a while, you should
    probably "swap out" your experiment (See the question <a
    href="#UTT-Swapping">What is Swapping</a> in this FAQ). It is
    especially important to swap out your experiment if you're through
    with it for the weekend. Emulab usually gets heavy use on the
    weekends by users who need to make very large experiments, so it
    is important to leave as many nodes available as possible.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="UTT-TOOFEW"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>What if I need more nodes than are free?</b></font>
    <p>
    For example, say you need 50 nodes but there are only 40 free. In
    general, getting this many nodes is going to require intervention
    from Testbed Operations, if only so we can ask other experimenters
    to free up nodes, if possible. Please send us email if you are not
    able to able to get the number of nodes you need for your experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
    Another alternative is to use the
    <a href="tutorial/tutorial.php3#BatchMode">Batch System.</a> 
    If your experiment is amenable to being batched (does not require
    human intervention to start and stop), then you can submit a batch
    request, which will be serviced when enough nodes become
    available.  Typically, you would start out with a few nodes,
    getting used to the batch system and creating whatever scripts are
    needed to make the experiment batchable. Then scale up to larger
    numbers of nodes. Thats the easiest way of getting a lot of nodes!
    </p>    
    
<li><a NAME="UTT-2"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Do I get root access on my nodes?</b></font>
    <p>
    Yes. Project leaders get root access to all of the nodes in all of
    the experiments that are running in their project. Project members
    get root if their project leader grants them root access, when the
    leader approves the group <a href="#GS-1">membership request</a>.
    Root privileges are granted via the <code>sudo</code> command. The
    <a href="tutorial/tutorial.php3#RootAccess">tutorial</a> describes
    this in more detail.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="UTT-3"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Do my nodes have consoles I can look at?</b></font>
    <p>
    Yes. Each of the PCs has its own serial console line with which you can
    interact, either directly from your desktop (see next FAQ entry),
    or by hopping through the "users" machine,
    using our <tt>console</tt> program. To connect over serial line to
    "pc1" in your experiment, ssh into <b>users.emulab.net</b>, and
    then type <tt>console pc1</tt> at the Unix prompt. You may then
    interact with the serial console (hit "enter" to elicit output from
    the target machine).
    </p><p>
    In any case, all console output from each node is saved
    so that you may look at it it later. For each node,
    the console log is stored as <tt>/var/log/tiplogs/pcXXX.run</tt>.
    This <em>run</em> file is created when nodes are first allocated
    to an experiment, and the Unix permissions of the run files permit
    only members of the project to view them. When the nodes are

    The Sharks also have serial console lines, but because of the
    limited number of serial ports available on <b>users.emulab.net</b>, only
    one Shark, the last or "eighth", on each shelf has a console line
    attached. To connect to that shark, you would type <tt>console shXX</tt>
    at the Unix prompt, where "XX" is the shark shelf number. The
    shark shelf number is the first digit in the name. Using shark
    sh16-8 as an example, the shelf number is sixteen, and the number
    of the node on the shelf is eight.

    Clicking "Connect to Serial Line"
    in the Node Options page will send your browser a "text/x-testbed-acl"
    ".tbacl" file. 
    In windows, if you have installed <code>tiptunnel</code>, available
    below, you can save this file in a folder and double-click it
    to launch a tunneled connection to your node.
    In FreeBSD or Linux, you can save the file and pass it as an argument
    to <code>tiptunnel</code>, or associate it with
    <code>tiptunnel</code> in your web browser.
    Upon connection you typically first have to hit "enter" to
    elicit output from the target machine.

<!--
    If you have downloaded <code>tiptunnel</code> and set it as the 
    handler for that MIME type, <code>tiptunnel</code> will launch a new 
    telnet running in a new xterm (this may take a few seconds.) 
    That telnet will be connected to a local port, 
    which is tunneled through SSL to your node's console. 
    Closing the xterm, exiting telnet, or killing <code>tiptunnel</code>
    itself will end the connection. -->

<li><a NAME="UTT-SCROGGED"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>I've scrogged my disk! Now what?</b></font>
    <p>
    If you manage to corrupt a disk (or slice), no worries. You can easily
    repair the damage yourself by reloading a fresh copy of the default
    disk image. You will of course lose anything you have stored on that
    disk; it is a good idea to store only data that can be easily recreated, 
    or else store it in your project directory in <tt>/proj</tt>. Disk
    reloading is covered in more detail in the
    <a href="tutorial/tutorial.php3#Scrogged">Emulab Tutorial</a>.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="UTT-5"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Where do I 
    store files needed by my experiment?</b></font>
    <p>
    Each project has its own directory, rooted at <tt>/proj</tt>,
    which is available via NFS to all of the nodes in experiments
    running in that project. For example, when the "RON" project was
    created, a directory called /proj/RON was also created. This
    directory is owned by the project creator, and is in the unix
    group "RON." Its permission (mode) is 770; read/write/execute
    permitted by the project creator and by all of the members of the
    project RON, but protected against all access by people outside
    the RON project.
    </p>
    <p>
    Project members are encouraged to store any files needed by their
    experiments in the corresponding /proj project directory. 
    </p>

<li><a NAME="UTT-6"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Are my files on 
    <b>users.emulab.net</b> backed up (filesaved)?</b></font>
    <p>
    Yes. All of the files in your home directory on /users, and all of
    the files in your project directory in /proj are filesaved. While
    we can restore lost files in an emergency, we encourage you to
    back up critical data on your own to avoid (possibly long) delays
    in conducting your experiments.
    </p>
    
<li><a NAME="UTT-7"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Are the nodes 
    in my experiment backed up (filesaved)?</b></font>
    <p>
    No! The nodes in your experiment are not filesaved. Any changes
    you make to the local filesystems will be lost if the event of a
    disk failure. We plan to provide a mechanism for experimenters to
    create snapshots of their node state, but that is not done yet. In
    the meantime, any files that must not be lost should be stored in
    the project directory (/proj/<project_name>), which is available
    via NFS to all of the nodes in your experiment. You may also store
    files in your home directory (/users/<login>), also available via
    NFS to all of your nodes, but that is not the preferred location
    since quotas on /users are relatively small.
    </p>
    
<li><a NAME="UTT-Swapping"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>What is Swapping?</b></font>
    <p>
    Swapping is when you (or we, or the Emulab system) temporarily swaps
    out your experiment,
    releasing all of the nodes in the experiment. Your experiment is
    still resident in the Emulab database, and you can see its status
    in the web interface, but no nodes are allocated. Once an
    experiment is swapped out, you can swap it back in via the web
    interface by going to the Experiment Information page for your
    experiment, and clicking on the swapin option. 
    You can also <a href="UTT-Modify">modify it</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <tt>idle-swap</tt> checkbox in the Begin Experiment web page
    is used to determine what experiments can be <em>automatically</em>
    swapped by the testbed scheduling system. Note that all experiments are
    capable of being swapped; even if you do not check the idle-swap box,
    you are free to swap your own experiments as you like. The only
    difference is that the testbed scheduling system will not consider your
    experiment when looking for experiments to swap out. You will sometimes
    notice that the Experiment Information page does not contain the swap
    link. That is because experiments cannot be swapped when they are in
    transition. For example, when the experiment is being swapped in (say,
    after first being created) the link will disappear until the experiment
    is fully swapped in, and it is capable of being swapped out. You will
    need to occasionally reload the page so that the updated state is
    recognized and the swap link appears. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Be aware that we do not currently save any files that you may have
    placed on your nodes. When your experiment is swapped back in, you
    will likely get different nodes, with fresh copies of the disk
    images. For that reason, you should not swap your experiment out
    unless you make arrangements to save and restore any state you need.
    </p>

    <p>
    <em>Please be sure to read our 
    <a href="docwrapper.php3?docname=swapping.html"> Node Usage Policies</a></em>,
    which contain detailed information on swapping.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="UTT-Restart"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>What is Experiment Restart?</b></font>
    <p>
    Experiment restart (or perhaps more aptly, replay) allows you to
    rerun your experiment from scratch, but without the added expense
    of a swapin and swapout. In other words, the nodes that are
    currently allocated to your experiment are all rebooted, and the
    experiment startup state is cleared. This includes the
    <a href="#SWS-6">ready bits</a>, the boot status in the web page,
    and the <a href="#SWS-4">startup command status</a>. In addition,
    the event scheduler for the experiment is restarted, and your event
    sequence is replayed again. Note that your rpms and tarfiles are
    <b>not</b> installed again. Replay is obviously faster than
    swapout/swapin, and has the added benefit that you will not run
    the risk of not being able to swapin for lack of available nodes.

<li><a NAME="UTT-8"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>How can I 
    get switch statistics (such as packet counts) for my experiment?</b></font>
    <p>
    We have a command called <code>portstats</code> that allows you access
    to some of the port counters on our switches. To use it, you'll need
    to ssh to <b>users.emulab.net</b>. '<code>portstats &lt;pid&gt; 
    &lt;eid&gt;</code>' will get you stats for all experimental interfaces in
    your experiment. Run '<code>portstats -h</code>' to get a list of other
    options, such as different sets of stats.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that the numbers returned by <code>portstats</code> do not get
    reset between experiments.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="UTT-Naming"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>What names should I use to refer to the nodes in my
    experiment?</b></font>

    <p>We set up names for your nodes in DNS, for use from outside,
    and <code>/etc/hosts</code> files for use on the nodes in the experiment.
    Since our nodes have multiple interfaces (the control network, and,
    depending on the experiment, possibly several experimental interfaces,)
    determining which name refers to which interface can be somewhat
    confusing. The rules below should help you figure this out.
    </p>

    <ul>
	<li><b>From the outside world</b> - 
	We set up names in the form
	<code><i>node</i>.<i>expt</i>.<i>proj</i>.emulab.net</code> in DNS,
	so that they visible anywhere on the Internet. This name always refers
	to the node's control network interface, which is the only one
	reachable from the outside world.
	</li>

	<li><b>On the nodes themselves</b> -
	There are three basic ways to refer to the interfaces of a node. The
	first is stored in DNS, and the second two are stored on the node in
	the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file.
	<ol>
	    <li><i>Fully-qualified hostnames</i> - These names the same ones
	    visible from the outside world, and referred to by attaching the
	    full domain name: ie.
	    <code><i>node</i>.<i>expt</i>.<i>proj</i>.emulab.net</code>. (note
	    that, since we put <code>.emulab.net</code> in nodes' domain
	    search paths, you can use
	    <code><i>node</i>.<i>expt</i>.<i>proj</i></code> as a shorthand.)
	    This name always refers to the control network
	    </li>

	    <li><i><code>node-link</code> form</i> - You can refer to an
	    individual experimental interface by suffixing it with the name of
	    the link or LAN (as defined in your NS file) that it is a member
	    of. For example, <code>nodeA-link0</code> or
	    <code>server-serverLAN</code>. This is the preferred way to refer
	    to experimental interfaces, since it uniquely and unambiguously
	    identifies an interface.
	    </li>

	    <li><i>Short form</i> - If a node is directly connected to the
	    node you're on, you can refer to that node simply with its name
	    (eg. <code>nodeA</code>.) Note that this differs from the fully-
	    qualified name in that no domain is given. If you have enabled
	    <a href="#SWS-5">routing</a>, we also create short names for 
	    any node that you have a route to. However, if two nodes are
	    connected with more than one interface, or there is more than
	    one route between them, there is no guarantee that the short name
	    has been associated with the one is on the 'best' (ie. shortest or
	    highest bandwidth) path - so, if there is ambiguity, we strongly
	    suggest that you use the <code><i>node-link</i></code> form.
	    </li>
	</li>
    </ul>
<br>
<li><a NAME="UTT-Modify"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Can I modify my experiment after creating it?
    </b></font>

    <p>Yes. On the experiment view page, choose "Modify this Experiment".
       This will allow you to modify an experiment, either swapped-out or in,
       by editing its NS file.</p>
    <p>If the experiment is swapped-out, 
       Experiment Modify will simply replace its topology with the
       newly specified one;
       this new topology will be mapped when the experiment is swapped in.</p>
    <p>If the experiment is already swapped-in, Modify will change the topology
       and map in the portions which have been changed. This allows dynamic
       addition, subtraction, and replacement of an experiment's nodes and links.
       However, when modifying swapped-in experiments, there are a couple
       things to keep in mind:
       <ul>
         <li>Any node with the same name in the old and new topology will remain
	 on the same physical machine, unaffected-- its disk will not be reloaded.
	 If you want to, for example, change the hardware on a machine, you will
	 have to call the machine something different in the new topology.
	 </li>
	 <br>
	 <li>
	 It is highly recommended that you leave the
	 "Reboot nodes in experiment" box checked in the Experiment Modify form.
	 This is especially important if changing your experiment topology 
         (adding or removing nodes, links, and LANs).
	 If adding/removing a delay to/from an existing link, or replacing 
	 a lost node <i>without modifying the experiment topology</i>,
	 this won't be necessary.
	 </li>
	 <li>
	 The event system is not automatically restarted for your
	 experiment, so you will not be able to modify the traffic
	 shaping for new links. In addition, if you add program
	 agents or traffic generators, these will not activate unless
	 you restart the event system by hand. Unfortunately, all
	 events will be replayed, so be careful: On
	 <tt>users.emulab.net</tt>, you may do the following:
	     <blockquote>
	     	<code>
	        eventsys_control [-f] replay pid eid

    When a choice of OS is available, you may specify which one you
    prefer for each node in the NS file using the Emulab
    <tt>tb-set-node-os</tt> extension to NS. When your experiment is
    configured, the appropriate disk image will be loaded on your

    will be installed (but only RPMs that have not already been
    installed).

    <font size='+1'><b>How can I turn on routing or set up routes automatically 
    in my nodes?</b></font>
    <p>
    By default, we do not setup any static routes or run any routing daemon
    on nodes in an experiment.  However, we do provide several options for
    experimenters, which are described in the
    <a href="tutorial/tutorial.php3#Routing">"Setting up IP routing

<li><a NAME="SWS-6"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>How does my software determine when other nodes in my
    experiment are ready?</b></font>
    <p>
    If your application requires synchronization to determine when all
    of the nodes in your experiment have started up and are ready to
    proceed, then you can use the Testbed's <i>ready bits</i>
    mechanism. The ready bits are really just a way of determining how
    many nodes have issued the <b>ready</b> command, and is returned
    to the application as a simple N of M string, where N is the
    number that have reported in, and M is the total number of nodes
    in the experiment. Applications can use this as a very simplistic
    form of barrier synchronization, albeit one that can be used just
    once and one that does not actually block!
    </p>
    <p>
    Use of the ready bits is described in more detail in the <a href =
    "tutorial/tutorial.php3">Emulab Tutorial</a> and in the <a href =
    "doc/docwrapper.php3?docname=tmcd.html"> Testbed Master Control
    Daemon</a> documentation.
    </p>
    
<li><a NAME="SWS-7"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Can I run my own Operating System?</b></font>
    <p>
    Yes! You can run your own OS (or a customized version of an Emulab
    supported OS) on any of the PCs. You can also run <a href =
    "http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/">OSKit</a> kernels on the
    PCs. Each of the PCs is partitioned with two DOS partitions large
    enough to hold the typical OS installation. The 1st and 2nd
    partitions are each 3GB. The 3rd partition is 500MB, and is
    labeled as Linux Swap. The 4th partition is the remainder of the
    disk, and varies in size depending on the pc type. We recommend
    that you use the 1st or 2nd partition; using the 4th partition
    will restrict the number of machines that you can run your OS on
    since it varies in size. Note that you must leave the MBR (Master
    Boot Record) in sector 0 alone, and that your custom partition
    must contain a proper DOS boot record in the first sector.
    </p>

    <p>
    Please note that while users are free to customize their disks and
    install their own operating systems, Emulab staff will not be able
    to offer more than encouragement and advice! We cannot install the
    OS for you, and we cannot load CDROMS, floppy disks, or tape drives!
    We <em>do</em> provide an easy way for you to boot FreeBSD from a
    memory based filesystem (MFS) so that you can more easily work
    with the disk (in case it is not possible to install your OS on a
    live disk). Beyond that, you are pretty much on your own!
    </p>

    <p>
    Many users had great success with customizing an Emulab supported
    OS (FreeBSD or Linux), and then creating a disk image that is
    autoloaded when the experiment is swapped in. We strongly
    encourage people to use this approach whenever possible! There is
    more information available in the <a

    </b></font>
    <p>
    No. At this time you cannot share OS images between projects. We
    are thinking of adding project collaboration support, but that is
    a future project.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the meantime, you will need to create an
    <a href="https://www.emulab.net/newimageid_ez.php3">image
    descriptor</a> in the project that wants to use your image. Fill out
    the form, but leave out the "Node to Obtain Snapshot from". Then

<li><a NAME="SWS-8"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>What if I need more disk space on my nodes?</b></font>
    <p>
    Each node has a partition at the end of the disk that you can use if
    you wish. In Linux, the partition is <code>/dev/hda4</code> ; in FreeBSD,
    it's </code>/dev/ad0s4</code> . There is no filesystem on this partition,
    so you'll need to create it yourself. For example, in Linux:
    <blockquote>
	<code>
	    mkfs /dev/hda4;<br>
	    mount /dev/hda4 /mnt;
	</code>
    </blockquote>
    This partition is only 6 Gigs, the size of the leftover space on our
    smallest drives. If you need more space than this, it would be possible
    to enlarge this partition on some machines (for example, our pc850s
    have 40 GB disks), but that is outside the scope of this FAQ.

<li><a NAME="SWS-9"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>Are there testbed-specific 
    daemons that could interfere with my experiment?</b></font>
    <p>
    Probably not.
    By default, the testbed startup scripts currently start two daemons in 
    addition to the OS's standard set.  Other daemons may be started depending
    on the network services you ask for in your ns file (see below).
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Unconditionally started daemons:</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    <blockquote>
    <li><code>healthd</code> - A low overhead hardware health monitor.</li>
    </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p> 
    This deamon periodically polls the machine's health monitoring
    hardware and sends this information back to our <code>boss</code>
    node for analysis.  The hardware is polled once per second, and a
    status datagram is sent out once every five minutes.
    <code>Healthd</code>'s overhead is quite low, but it can be safely
    killed and disabled from startup if you're worried about possible
    side effects.  It is started by
    <code>/etc/testbed/rc.healthd</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <blockquote>
    <li><code>slothd</code> - A low overhead usage analysis tool.</li>
    </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
    <code>Slothd</code> is important to efficient testbed utilization
    and should run on every node whenever possible.  Its overhead is
    almost negligible (essentially less than running <code>'ls -l
    /dev'</code> once every five minutes), and should not interfere with your
    work.  However if your experiment is exceptionally sensitive, then
    you may arrange with us to disable <code>slothd</code>.  Please
    note that we will restart this daemon if it is not running unless
    prior arrangements have been made.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
    <blockquote>
    <li><code>gated</code> - A network routing daemon.</li>
    </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
    If you have requested automatic routing on your nodes with  
    <code>$ns&nbsp;rtproto&nbsp;Session</code> in your NS file, this will
    start <code>gated</code> on all of your nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
    We have left all daemons started by the operating systems' default
    configurations (such as <code>cron</code>) enabled, so you should also

      In short, yes, the local nodes in Emulab (but not all remote
      Netbed nodes) support IP Multicast on the experimental
      network. In order to use it, you must have a kernel that
      supports it, and if you want multicast routing, you'll need to
      enable <code>mrouted</code>. (You can do it manually, or
      automatically via program objects or startup commands, but the

<li><a NAME="TR-1"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>My experiment is set up, but I cannot
	send packets between some of the nodes. Why?</b></font>
    <p>
    The most common reason is that your topology
    includes nodes which are not directly connected, and you have
    not setup any routing.  Refer to
    "<a href="#SWS-5">How can I turn on routing or set up routes
    automatically in my nodes?</a>" for details.  If you cannot
    send packets between two machines which are directly connected
    (via a link or a lan), then there are two possibilities:
    either the nodes did not properly negotiate their speed and
    duplex with the Cisco switch, or the physical wire is loose
    or bad.  In these cases, <a href="#GS-7a">you should contact us</a>
    for help.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="TR-2"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>I asked for traffic shaping, 
    but everything seems to be going at full LAN speeds.  
    What's wrong?</b></font>
    <p>
    The most likely problem is that it is using the unshaped control
    network for the traffic you're looking at. This occurs when it
    tries to contact a node using a "pcXXX" address, like pc76 or
    pc76.emulab.net, or when it tries to ping a fully-qualified name,
    like NodeA.myexpt.myproj.emulab.net , which also resolves to a
    control network address. On one of your nodes, take a look at the
    file /etc/hosts . It shows the IP addresses and aliases that refer
    to the different experimental interfaces. These are the names/IPs
    you can use to see the delays.
    </p>

    <p>
    For instance, let's say I have an experiment that had NodeA and
    NodeB connected with a shaped link. The file /etc/hosts on NodeA
    would have a line for NodeB, with an address like 192.168.1.3, and
    on NodeB there would be an entry for NodeA with the address
    192.168.1.2. These addresses correspond to the delayed link
    between them. Any address outside the 192.168.*.* range that you
    didn't configure manually corresponds to an unshaped link.

    <font size='+1'><b>I set a non-zero packet-loss (or delay) but 'ping'
        shows no packet-loss (or delay). Why?</b></font>
    <p>
    You are probably pinging through the control net interface. See this
    Troubleshooting <a href="#TR-2">FAQ entry</a>.
    </p>
    
<li><a NAME="TR-4"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>I set a non-zero packet-loss (or delay) but 'ping'
        shows a different packet-loss (or delay). Why?</b></font>
    <p>
    Short answer: Ping is round trip, PLR and delay are "one way".
    </p>

    <p>
    Long Answer: If you're not seeing any traffic shaping at all
    (100Mbps, 0ms, 0plr), see <a href="#TR-2">this FAQ entry</a>. If
    you are seeing shaping, but something different than you
    expected, it is probably because link characteristics are one
    way, and you're measuring them over the round trip.
    </p>

    <p>
    For instance, if you asked for a link that was 100Mbps, 30ms,
    with 5% (0.05) packet loss rate (plr), you may expect ping to
    show 30ms ping times and 5% loss rate. But what you should see
    is 60ms latency for the round trip, and a loss rate of
    9.75%. Latencies can be added, therefore 30ms + 30ms gives
    60ms. However, loss rates are probabilities, and must be
    multiplied. The chance of a packet making it across a 5% lossy
    link is 95%, so with a 95% chance of arriving at the
    destination, and a 95% chance of returning if it made it there,
    and the total chance of making a round trip is .95 * .95 = .9025 or
    90.25%, or a round trip loss rate of 9.75% on a 5% lossy link.

<li><a NAME="TR-5"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>I decreased the bandwidth on a link and now the
      ping time between the nodes has increased. Why?</b></font>
    <p>
    Short answer: Decreasing the bandwidth of a link means that your
    bytes take longer to get where they are going! 
    </p>

    <p>
    Long Answer: A ping packet is 98 bytes of data; 56 bytes of data
    plus 8 bytes of ICMP header plus 20 bytes of IP header plus 14
    bytes of ethernet header. At 100Mbs those 98 bytes takes .0078ms
    to traverse the wire, which is hardly noticeable! If you have set
    the delay of your link to 10ms, then your ping packets will incur
    10ms+0.0078ms of delay in each direction, for a 20ms roundtrip time.
    </p>

    <p>
    Say you set the bandwith of your link to 250Kbs. The wire time for
    those same 98 bytes is now 3ms. If your delay is 10ms like above,
    then your ping packets will incur 10ms+3ms of delay in each
    direction, for a 26ms roundtrip time! If you set the bandwith to
    100Kbs, the wire time is now 7.8ms and your ping packets will
    incur 10ms+7.8ms of delay in each direction, for a 35.6ms roundtrip
    time!
    </p>

    <p>
    Note: If you have a router connecting two nodes, then <em>each of
    the two links</em> will incur the same wire time (and delay of
    course). In the above 250Kbs example, each ping packet will incur
    3ms of wire time to the router and <em>another</em> 3ms from the
    router to the destination. The ping reply packet will see the same
    6ms of wire time. If your delay is again 10ms, then the ping
    roundtrip is 52ms. 
    </p>    
</ul>
