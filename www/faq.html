<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ul>
<li><a NAME="GS-1"></a>
    <h4>How do I start a project?</h4>
    <p>
    If you are new to the Testbed, simply click on the "Start Project"
    link on the Emulab <a href="https://www.emulab.net">Home
    Page</a>. You will need to fill in the forms with your personal
    information and information about the project. Then click on the
    "Submit" button. Within a few days you will be contacted via email
    with an approval message. More information about starting projects
    can be found in <a href="auth.html">Authorization Page</a>.
    <p>
    If you already have an Emulab account, and wish to start a second
    project, first log into the Web Interface. Then select the "Start
    Project" link; all of the personal information will already be
    filled in. You will need to complete just the project information
    section. 
    </p>

<li><a NAME="GS-2"></a>
    <h4>Someone told me to join their project. How do I do that?</h4>
    <p>
    If you are new to the Testbed, simply click on the "Join Project"
    link on the Emulab <a href="https://www.emulab.net">Home
    Page</a>. You will need to fill in the form with your personal
    information, and provide the name of the project you are trying to
    join (typically, the <i>Project Leader</i> will have told you the
    name of the project). The click on the "Submit" button, and wait
    for the project leader to approve you.  When approved you will
    receive an email message saying so, and you can then log into the
    Testbed.
</ul>

<h3>Using the Testbed</h3>
<ul>
<li><a NAME="UTT-1"></a>
    <h4>Is there a tutorial?</h4>
    <p>
    Yes, we have an extensive <a href="tutorial/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>
    on using the Testbed.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="UTT-2"></a>
    <h4>Do I get root access on my nodes?</h4>
    <p>
    Yes. Project leaders get root access to all of the nodes in all of
    the experiments that are running in their project. Project members
    get root if their project leader grants them root access, when the
    leader approves the group <a href="#GS-1">membership request</a>.
    Root privileges are granted via the <code>sudo</code> command. The
    <a href="tutorial/tutorial.html#RootAccess">tutorial</a> describes
    this in more detail.
