    <h1>Utah&nbsp;Network&nbsp;Testbed<br>Web&nbsp;Interface&nbsp;FAQ</h1>
    
    <p> <b>Welcome to the Utah Network Testbed. We hope to make your
      experience with us very positive, and hope that you'll return,
      and recommend the testbed to others.</b>

    <p> <b>We hope to make the testbed very easy to use, yet flexible
      enough to do whatever you need it to do. This web interface will 
      allow you to enter the appropriate data that we need to be able
      to help you better.</b>

    <p> <b>To protect any data you submit, SSL is used to encrypt data 
	as it is transfered accross the Internet. Subsequently, you
	will need to access these pages with a browser that supports
	it. They are best viewed with Netscape (4.0 or greater
	recommended), and we recommend a screen resolution of at least 
	800x600 to avoid excessive scrolling.</b>

      <li><h3>So why do I need to use these web pages, anyway?</h3>
    <p>We need to get some information from you, both for security, 
      and for management of Testbed resources. These web pages
      will let you apply for an account to be able to use the
      testbed, and will let you perform management operations
      within your accounts limits.
    </p>
    <li><h3>What do I need to do to be able to use the Testbed?</h3>
    <p>If you're here on your own, or you're the leader of a group
      of people who want to use the Testbed, the first step is to
      apply for a group. A group is an entity that has been approved 
      to use the Testbed, and the group leader is held responsible
      for the actions of members of his group. He can allow users to 
      join his group and use the Testbed as a member of his group.
      To get a group, click on the link in the side bar titled
      'Apply for a Group'. Fill out the requested information, and
      your request will be submitted to the Approval Committee.
    </p>
    <li><h3>Someone told me to join their group. How do I do
      that?</h3>
    <p>The process of joining an existing group is quite
      simple. Go to the 'Apply for Group Membership' page, fill out
      the form, and wait for the group leader to approve you. Then
      you're in. Your group leader primarily will control how much
      access you have to Testbed resources, within the limits given
      to the group as a whole.
    </p>
    <li><h3>I'm already a Testbed user, but I'm collaborating with
      another group. How can I join that group too?</h3>
    <p>Go back to the 'Apply for Group Membership' page, put in
      your username and password, and the group you want to join. We 
      already have everything else on file. Then submit the request, 
      and the leader of the group you want to join will be notified, 
      and if he approves you, you'll be a member of his group as
      well.
    </p>
    <li><h3>I've been approved. How do I use my account?</h3>
    <p>The first step would be to come back here and log in. That
      will ap on any available options in the side bar. You might
      be authorized to start projects or experiments, or maybe
      you'll just be authorized to use the nodes in an
      experiment. Either way, your options will show up in the side
      bar. If someone in your group starts a project or experiment,
      they'll need to ap you to it if they want you in it. Once
      they do that, they can tell you what nodes are reserved for
      the experiment, and your unix account on those nodes will be
      automatically created, and you should be able to use ssh to
      log into those machines. Likewise, you'll have an account on
      the control machine, and will be able to log into the machines 
      via the serial line console as well.
    </p>
    <li><h3>You still haven't answered my question. Who can I
      ask?</h3>
    <p>You can try the other web pages for the Testbed, located on the
      <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/testbed/"> Testbed
	Homepage</a>, or in the <a
	href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/testbed/doc/"> Testbed 
	Documentation</a>. When all else fails, you can send e-mail
      to <a href="mailto:newbold@cs.utah.edu">Mac Newbold
	(newbold@cs.utah.edu)</a>.
    </p>
