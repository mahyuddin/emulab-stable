    <font size='+1'><b>What is software defined radio (SDR)?</b></font>
    <p>Software defined radio (SDR) is a system where changeable
       software is used to process digital signals sent and/or
       received by accompanying radio frequency hardware.  This is in
       contrast to traditional radios, where the signal processing
       logic is mainly hardcoded into custom hardware with only
       limited control over how the signal is handled.
    </p>

    <font size='+1'><b>What is GNU Radio?</b></font>
    <p>Gnu Radio is a free extensible software kit for experimenting
       with software defined radio (SDR) that runs on a general
       purpose computer, such as a PC or a Mac.  This software suite
       is normally coupled with hardware (such as the USRP) that
       captures radio frequency (RF) signals and converts them from
       analog to digital.  The GNU Radio software operates on this
       digital representation of the radio signal.
    </p>

<li><a NAME="WhatIsUSRP"></a>
    <font size='+1'><b>What is the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)?</b></font>
    <p>The Universal Software Radio Peripheral, or USRP for short, is
       a hardware platform designed to work with the GNU Radio
       software kit.  It is comprised of an extensible motherboard
       that can accomodate up to four peripheral daughtercards.
       Digital to Analog (D/A) and analog to digital (A/D) converters
       on the motherboard change the signal to and from digital as it
       passes between the the motherboard and daughtercards.  A
       programmable FPGA on the motherboard can perform mathematical
       transforms on the digital signals quickly.  Data is shuttled to
       and from the motherboard and general purpose computer through a
       USB 2.0 connection.
    </p>
    <p>Several USRP daughtercards are already available, with many more
       planned.  These include a UHF receiver (50MHz - 800MHz), basic
       transmit and receive boards for use with external equipment, and
       ISM band transmiters and receivers (e.g. 2.4GHz band).
