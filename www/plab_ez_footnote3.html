	A space-separated list of paths to RPMs. You can supply either URLs
	from which we should fetch the RPMs, or paths to files on
	<code>users.emulab.net</code>.  For example:
	<blockquote>
	    <code>http://www.myU.edu/~me/myrpm.rpm</code>
	    <p>or</p>
	    <code>/proj/myproj/rpms/myrpm.rpm</code>
	</blockquote>
	These RPMs will be installed in all slivers in the slice, and you can push
	out updates to them while the slice is running.
