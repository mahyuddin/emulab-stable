     <h3>Beginning an Experiment</h3>

<p>
After logging on to the Emulab Web Interface, choose the "Begin
Experiment" option from the menu. First select which project you want
the experiment to be configured in. Most people will be a member of just
one project, and will not have a choice. If you are a member of
multiple projects, be sure to select the correct project from the
menu.

<p>
Next fill in the `Name' and `Description fields. The Name should be a
single word (no spaces) identifier, while the Description is a multi
word description of your experiment. In the "Your NS file" field,
place the <i>local path</i> of a NS file which you have created to
describe your network topology. This file will be uploaded through
your browser when you choose "Submit."
<p>
    In submitting a topology, you can ask for as many nodes as are currently available. You can
    click on the "Node Reservation Status" link at your left to see
    how many nodes are currently free. If you ask for more than are
    currently available, your experiment will be rejected (you
    will receive email notification shortly after you submit your NS
    file to the web interface).
    </p>

    <p>
    <em>We urge all new Emulab users to begin with a small 3-4 node
    experiment so that you will become familiar with NS syntax and the
    practical aspects of Emulab operation.</em>
    </p>
<p>
After submission, Emulab will begin processing your
request. This will likely take several minutes, depending on how large
your topology is, and what other features (such as delay nodes and
bandwidth limits) you are using. Assuming all goes well, you will
receive an email message indicating success or failure, and if
successful, a listing of the nodes and IP address that were allocated
to your experiment. 


 <p><h3>Problem?</h3>
    If your submission fails because there are not enough nodes available, do not repeatedly re-submit
	the experiment every few minutes.  It wastes your time and floods
    us with email (we get every failure message you do!)
    Instead, you can now use the
    <a href="tutorial/tutorial.php3#BatchMode">Batch System</a> <!-- bad link -->
    to queue an interactive job.  By submitting your experiment as
    a batch job, but without any
    <a href="tutorial/tutorial.php3#Startupcmd"><tt>tb-set-node-startcmd</tt></a> <!-- bad link? -->
    directives in your NS file, the job will be queued until nodes are
    available.  For most experiments, this means just using your regular
    NS file, and checking the Batch Mode Experiment box when you create
    the experiment. <b>Note:</b> if your experiment requires a large proportion
	of the total Emulab nodes, you likely require <A HREF="mailto:testbed-ops@flux.utah.edu">Testbed Operations intervention</A>
	to get your experiment off the ground.
    </p><p>
    When your queued job is swapped in, you will be sent email to
    inform you, and you can start working!
    <b>Please note</b> that the
    experiment will be idle when it is swapped in, and will be
    <a href="swapping.html#idleswap">idle swapped</a> <!-- bad link -->if you do not
    get things running on the nodes in a short period of time.  If your
    experiment does get swapped out before you can get to it, you can
    always visit the experiment's information page and try again by
    using the Queue Batch Experiment menu item.
    </p>
