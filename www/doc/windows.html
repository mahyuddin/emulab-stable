<h3><a name="Overview"> </a> Overview </h3>

Microsoft <i>Windows XP</i> is now supported as one of the operating system
types for experiment nodes in Emulab, in addition to FreeBSD and Linux.
<a href="../kb-show.php3?xref_tag=SWS-WIN2K">Windows 2000</a> is not supported. <p>

As much as possible, we have left Windows XP "stock".  Some Windows services
are shut down: Messenger, SSDP Discovery Service, Universal Plug and Play
Device Host, and Remote Registry.  Other setting changes are described under 
<a href="#Network_config"> Network config </a> and
<a href="#Routing"> Routing </a> below.  <p>

Before booting the node at swap-in time, Emulab loads a 
<a href="#Experiment_setup"> fresh image of Windows XP </a>
onto the experiment nodes in parallel, using our <code>frisbee</code> service.
Emulab software automatically configures each Windows XP node, providing the
expected experiment user environment including: user accounts and Emulab SSH
keys; remote home, project, and shared directories; and network connections.
All of the Emulab experiment automation and monitoring services have been ported
to run on Windows.
<p>

The <a href="#Cygwin"> Cygwin GNU </a> environment is provided, 
including Bash and TCSH shells, the
C/C++, Perl and Python programming languages, and several editors including
Emacs, vim, nano and ed.  <p>

The Emulab web interface manages a separate <a href="#Windows_Passwords"> 
Windows password </a> in the user
profile, as well as making <a href="#Login_connections"> login
connections </a> to the experiment nodes.
Remote Desktop Protocol service supports Windows Desktop logins from the
user's workstation screen to the experiment node.  SSH and Serial Console
command-line connections are also supported.  <p>

<i>Windows XP</i> installations are more hardware dependent than Linux or
FreeBSD.  At present, this <i>Windows XP</i> image only runs on the Emulab <a
href="../shownodetype.php3?node_type=pc850"> pc850 </a> and <a
href="docwrapper.php3?docname=pc3000.html"> pc3000 </a>node types.  <p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h3><a name="Differences"></a> Differences from FreeBSD and Linux in Emulab </h3>

The biggest difference of course, is that this is <b>Windows</b> (!), with
Cygwin layered on top, and Emulab management services added.  In particular,
this is Windows XP (NT 5.1), with various levels of service packs and updates
(see <a href="#Experiment_setup">below</a>.) <p>

The second-biggest difference is that shared directories are provided not by
the NFS (Network File System) protocol, but instead by the <b>SMB</b> (Server
Message Block) protocol, otherwise known as Windows File Sharing.  The Client
for Microsoft Networks software contacts the SMB server, in this case
<b>Samba</b> running on the file server known as <b>Fs</b> (an alias for
<b>Users</b>.)  The SMB protocol
authenticates using a plain-text user name and password, encrypted as they go
across the network.  (These Windows Shares are then accessed by UNC paths
under Cygwin mounts, <a href="#SMB_mounts">described below</a>.) <p>

<h4><a name="Windows_Passwords"> </a> Windows Passwords </h4>

A separate <b>Windows password</b> is kept for use only with experiment nodes
running Windows.  It is presented behind-the-scenes to <code>rdesktop</code>
for RDP logins by our Web interface under Unix, and for the Samba mount of
shared directories like your home directory under an ssh login, so you don't
have to type it in those cases.  You <u>will</u> have to type it each time if
you use the <a href="#Login_connections"> Microsoft RDC (Remote Desktop
Connector) client program</a> from a Windows machine.<p>

The default Windows password is randomly generated.  It's easy to change it to
something easier to remember. <p>

To see or edit your Windows password, log in to Emulab, and click <b>Manage
User Profile</b> and then <b>Edit Profile</b> under <b>User Options</b>.  You
will see <b>Windows Password</b> fields in addition to the regular Emulab
<b>Password</b> fields. <p>

When you change your Windows password, you will also have to re-type it as a
check.  The new Windows password should propagate to the Samba server on Fs
instantly, so you can swap in an experiment and log in to its Windows nodes
with the new password. <p>

If you have already swapped-in experiment nodes and change your Windows
password, the account information including passwords will be updated at the
next Emulab watchdog daemon <code>isalive</code> interval.  This should be in
3 to 6 minutes. <p>

<h4><a name="Experiment_setup"> </a> Experiment setup for Windows nodes </h4>

All you have to do is put a line specifying a WINXP OS image in your
experiment .ns file, like this:
<pre>
    tb-set-node-os $node WINXP-UPDATE
    tb-set-hardware $node pc850
</pre>

Notice that the above image only runs on the <a
href="../shownodetype.php3?node_type=pc850"> pc850 </a> Emulab node type.  At
present, you have to explicitly specify a different image name and hardware
type to run on the <a href="docwrapper.php3?docname=pc3000.html"> pc3000's
</a>.  For example:
<pre>
    tb-set-node-os $node WINXP-UPDATE-pc3000
    tb-set-hardware $node pc3000
</pre>


Currently available Windows XP images are:

<ul>

  <li><b>WINXP-UPDATE</b> (pc850), and <b>WINXP-UPDATE-pc3000</b> - Windows
  XP-SP2+.  These are updated periodically from Windows Update, typically after
  a Microsoft "Patch Tuesday", the second Tuesday of each month.  All critical
  and security fixes are installed, up through the date we pull the image
  file. (See the date created field on the individual WINXP <a
  href="https://www.emulab.net/showimageid_list.php3"> Image ID's </a>).  <p>

  Note: The Windows Firewall is disabled by default (as it will inform you
  repeatedly!)
  </li>

  <li><b>WINXP-SP2(-pc3000)</b> - Windows XP-SP2.  This has the original SP2 on it,
  with no Windows Update modifications beyond that.  (SP2 includes SP1.)
  </li>

  <li><b>WINXP-SP1(-pc3000)</b> - Windows XP-SP1a.  This is intended for
  software (in)security work, and has only the updated version of SP1
  (a.k.a. SP1a) installed.
  </li>

  <li><b>WINXP-SP0(-pc3000)</b> - Windows XP, from the original 2001 MSDN CD,
  with the Emulab client-side management code ported to it.  This is intended
  for software (in)security work, and has no service packs at all.
  </li>

  <li><b>WINXP-BASE(-pc3000)</b> - Raw Windows XP, from the original 2001 MSDN
  CD.  There is no Emulab client-side <a href="#Overview"> management code
  </a> to set up and operate the node, or even Cygwin.  This is only useful
  for building custom images completely from scratch.
  </li>

</ul>

<h4><a name="Network_config"> </a> Network config </h4>

Some default Windows networking features are disabled.  <i>NetBT (NetBios over
TCP)</i> (<a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/library/DepKit/40c09844-a669-463c-94dc-7ccf7214083d.mspx">
NetbiosOptions=2 </a>) and <i>DNS auto-registration</i> (<a
href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q246804">
DisableDynamicUpdate=1 </a>) are disabled to allow network <a
href="../docwrapper.php3?docname=swapping.html#idleness"> idle detection </a>
by the <code>slothd</code> service.  <i>TCP/IP address autoconfiguration</i>
is disabled (<a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/Windows/2000/server/reskit/en-us/Default.asp?url=/resources/documentation/Windows/2000/server/reskit/en-us/regentry/58861.asp">
IPAutoconfigurationEnabled=0 </a>) so that unswitched interfaces like the
sixth NICs on the pc3000's don't get bogus Microsoft class B network
169.254.0.0 addresses assigned.  <p>

The Emulab pc850 node type has five network interfaces, and the pc3000 has
six.  However, the Windows <b><code>ipconfig /all</code></b> command only
shows the configuration information for the enabled network interfaces.  There
will always be one enabled <a
href="../tutorial/docwrapper.php3?docname=tutorial.html#ControlNet"> control net
</a> interface on the 155.98.36 network.  The others are disabled if not used
in your experiment.  <p>

If you specified links or LANs in your experiment <a
href="../tutorial/docwrapper.php3?docname=tutorial.html#Designing"> network
topology </a>, other interfaces will be enabled, with an IP address, subnet
mask, and gateway that you can specify in the NS file.

Notice that the Windows names of the interfaces start with <b><code>Local Area
Connection</code></b> and have a number appended.  You can't count on what this
number is, since it depends on the order the NIC's are probed as Windows
boots. <p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <b>NOTE:</b> Sometimes we have seen
<code>ipconfig</code> report an ip address and mask of <code>0.0.0.0</code>,
while the TCP/IP properties dialog boxes show the proper values.
<code>ipconfig</code> is wrong.  </div>

<h4><a name="Routing"> </a> Routing </h4>

Full-blown router nodes can not run Windows, i.e. <b><code>rtproto
Session</code></b> is not supported.  However, basic routing between connected
network components of your experiment topology works.  The Windows command to
see the routing tables is <b><code>route print</code></b>.  The <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/advanced/help/default.asp?url=/windows2000/en/advanced/help/sag_TCPIP_pro_EnableForwarding.htm">
IPEnableRouter=1 </a> registry key is set on multi-homed hosts in the
experiment network, before they are rebooted to change the hostname.<p>

<b><code>rtproto Static</code></b> is supported in all recent WINXP images,
but not in WINXP-02-16 or before. <p>

<b><code>rtproto Static-old</code></b> or <b><code>rtproto Manual</code></b>
will work in any image.<p>

There is more information on routing in the <a
href="../tutorial/docwrapper.php3?docname=tutorial.html#Routing">
Routing Section of the Emulab Tutorial. </a><p>

<h4><a name="Firewalls"> </a> Firewalls </h4>

Emulab.net is outside the University of Utah firewall, with only a minimal <a
href="../kb-show.php3?xref_tag=SI-FW"> outer firewall </a>, to allow free network
experimentation.  Even though we have closed most low-numbered ports, your
Windows XP experiment nodes are still exposed to the wider Internet on higher
port numbers.  <p>

If your experiment does not require that full freedom, consider adding a <a
href="../tutorial/docwrapper.php3?docname=firewall.html"> control net firewall
node </a> statement to your experiment ns file.  This allows you to control
the <a href="../tutorial/docwrapper.php3?docname=secure.html"> security level
</a> of your connection to the Internet by a <a
href="../tutorial/docwrapper.php3?docname=firewall.html#Use"> style keyword
</a>, for example:
<pre>
    set fw [new Firewall $ns]
    $fw set-type ipfw2-vlan
    $fw set-style basic
</pre>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <b>NOTE:</b> There is currently a problem
which makes swapping-in Windows nodes behind a control-net firewall take
longer or fail, especially on the pc850's.  <p>

Details: DHCP packets aren't passed until the firewall node is loaded with
FreeBSD and started up.  That takes 3-4 minutes on a pc850 and leaves the
Windows nodes in the FreeBSD PXE-loader image waiting for DHCP.  Periodically,
they time-out and reload the PXE-loader, which adds up to another minute after
the firewall node is up, if you're unlucky.  <p>

After 10 minutes in the reloading state, Emulab gives up and reboots the node
to try again, even if Frisbee is working hard and nearly done.  5-6 minutes is
hardly enough time to Frisbee a WINXP image into a pc850.  Either the image
load time-out needs to be extended in experiments that have a firewall
configured, or the load timer shouldn't start ticking until the firewall is
up. </div>

The <i>Windows Firewall</i> software is installed in WINXP-SP2 and
WINXP-UPDATE images, but disabled to allow RDP and SSH access to Windows
nodes.  <p>

<h4><a name="Boots_twice"> </a> Windows nodes boot twice </h4>

Notice that Windows reboots an extra time after being loaded onto a node
during swap-in.  It has to reboot after changing the node name to set up the
network stack properly.  Be patient, Windows doesn't boot fast. <p>

It's best not to log in to the nodes until the experiment is fully swapped-in.
(You may be able to log in briefly between the first two reboots; if you see
the wrong pcXXX name, you'll know that a reboot is imminent.)  You can know
that the swap-in process is finished by any of these methods:
<ul>
  <li> Waiting until you get the "experiment swapped in" email from Emulab.
  <li> Checking the node status on the experiment status page in Emulab.
       (You have to refresh the page to see node status change.)
  <li> Watching the realtime swap-in log to monitor its progress.
</ul>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <b>NOTE:</b> Sometimes we have seen Windows
XP fail to do the second reboot.  We're working on it.  If you try to login
after swap-in and your Windows password isn't honored, use this command on Ops
to remotely reboot the node:<pre>    node_reboot pcxxx</pre>

If you are able to log in but your remote home directory isn't mounted, you
have the additional option of executing this command on
the node itself: <pre>    /sbin/reboot</pre>

The EmulabStartup service runs <code>/usr/local/etc/emulab/rc/rc.bootsetup</code>,
logging output to <code>/var/log/bootsetup.log</code>.  If you're having swap-in
problems and rc.bootsetup doesn't finish sending <code>ISUP</code> to Emulab within
10 minutes, the node will be rebooted.  After a couple of reboot cycles without a
<code>ISUP</code>, Emulab gives up on the node.  <p>

If you want to prevent swap-in failure, whether to diagnose the problem or to continue
manually, you may add this line to your
<a href="../tutorial/docwrapper.php3?docname=nscommands.html"> ns file </a>
for each Windows node: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <code>
    <a href="../tutorial/docwrapper.php3?docname=nscommands.html#tb-set-node-failure-action"> 
    tb-set-node-failure-action</a> <i>$node</i> "nonfatal"
</code>  <br>
(where <code><i>$node</i></code> is replaced with the node variable, of course.)
<p>

It will still complain if it doesn't get the ISUP signal at the end of rc.bootsetup,
but the swap-in will proceed and allow you to figure out what's happening.  </div>

<h4><a name="Login_connections"> </a> Login connections to Windows </h4>

You can manually start up the SSH or RDP client programs to connect and log in
to nodes in your experiment, or use the <code>console</code> command on Ops.
You will have to type your <a href="#Windows_Passwords"> Windows
Password </a> when logging in, except for SSH when you have ssh-agent keys loaded. <p>

Or you can set up your browser to automatically connect in one click from the
Emulab web interface and pop up a connection window.
Once you start swapping in an experiment, the Emulab Experiment
Information page contains a table of the physical node ID and logical node
name, status, and connection buttons.  The captions at the top of the button columns link
to pages explaining how to set up up mime-types in your browser to make the
buttons work, from FreeBSD, Linux, and Windows workstations:

<ul>
       
  <li> <b>SSH</b> <a href="../docwrapper.php3?docname=ssh-mime.html">
       (setup) </a> - The <b>SSH</b> connection button gives a Bash or TCSH
       shell, as usual.  Your Emulab ssh keys are installed on the
       node in a /sshkeys subdirectory.  </li>

  <li> <b>Console</b> <a href="../kb-show.php3?xref_tag=tiptunnel"> (setup)
       </a> - The serial console is supported for Cygwin shell logins using
       the <code>agetty</code> and <code>sysvinit</code> packages.  This is
       the only way in when network connections are closed down!  You can
       also monitor the Frisbee loading and booting of the Windows image on
       the console.  </li>

  <li> <b>RDP</b> <a href="../docwrapper.php3?docname=rdp-mime.html">
       (setup) </a> - The <b>RDP</b> button starts up a Remote Desktop
       Protocol connection, giving a Windows Desktop login from the user's
       workstation screen to the experiment node.  
       <ul>

	 <li> The <b><code>rdesktop</code></b> client software is used from Linux and Unix 
	      client workstations. </li>

	 <li> A Microsoft <b>RDC</b> (Remote Desktop Connector) client program is
	      included in Windows XP, and may be installed onto other versions
	      of Windows as well.  It has the cute feature that you can make
	      it full-screen without (too much) confusion, since it hangs a
	      little tab at the top of the screen to switch back.
	      Unfortunately, we have no way to present your Emulab Windows
	      password to RDC, so you'll have to type it on each login.  </li>

       </ul>
</ul>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <b>NOTE:</b> If you import dot-files into
Emulab that replace the system execution search path rather than add to it,
you will have a problem running Windows system commands in shells.  Fix this
by adding <b><code>/cygdrive/c/WINDOWS/system32</code></b> and
<b><code>/cygdrive/c/WINDOWS</code></b> to your <code>$PATH</code> in
<code>~/.cshrc</code> and either <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or
<code>~/.profile</code>.  Don't worry about your home directory dot-files
being shared among Windows, FreeBSD, and Linux nodes; non-existent directories
in the <code>$PATH</code> are ignored by shells.  <p>

When new Emulab user accounts are created, the default CSH and Bash dotfiles
are copied from the FreeBSD /usr/share/skel.  They replace the whole $PATH
rather than add to it.  Then we append an Emulab-specific part that takes care
of the path, conditionally adding the Windows directories on Cygwin.  </div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <b>NOTE:</b> The Windows
<b><code>ping</code></b> program has <emph>completely</emph> different option
args from the Linux and FreeBSD ones, and they differ widely from each other.
There is a ping package in Cygwin that is a port of the 4.3bsd ping.  Its
options are close to a common subset of the Linux and FreeBSD options, so it
will be included in future WINXP images:
<pre> ping [ -dfqrv ] host [ packetsize [count [ preload]]] </pre> <p>

You can load it yourself now using <a href="#Cygwin_packages"> Cygwin Setup </a>.
</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <b>NOTE:</b> There are no Cygwin ports of
some other useful networking commands, such as <b><code>traceroute</code></b>
and <b><code>ifconfig -a</code></b>.  The Windows system equivalents are
<code>tracert</code> and <code>ipconfig /all</code>. </div>

<h4><a name="RDP_details"> </a> RDP details </h4>

Here are some fine points and hints for RDP logins to remote Windows desktops:

<ul>

  <li> Microsoft allows only <b>one desktop login at a time</b> to <i>Windows XP</i>,
       although this is the same Citrix Hydra technology that supports many
       concurrent logins to Terminal Server or Server 2003. <p>

       The <b>Fast User Switching</b> option to XP is turned on, so a second
       RDP connection disconnects a previous one rather than killing it.
       Similarly, just closing your RDP client window disconnects your Windows
       Login session rather than killing it. You can reconnect later on
       without losing anything. <p>

       <a name="QWINSTA"></a>
       SSH doesn't count as a desktop, so you can ssh in and use this command:
       <b><code>qwinsta</code></b> (Query WINdows STAtion) to show existing
       winstation sessions and their session ID's, and this one to reset
       (kill) a session by ID: <b><code>rwinsta</code></b> </li>

  <li> We rename <b>My Computer</b> to show the PCxxx physical node name, but
       it doesn't appear on the <i>Windows XP</i> desktop by default.  The XP
       user interface incorporates My Computer into the upper-right quadrant
       of the Start menu by default, and removes it from the desktop. <p>

       You can go back to the "classic" user interface of Windows 2000,
       including showing My Computer.  Right-click on the background of the
       Taskbar which contains the Start button at the left, and choose
       "Properties".  Select the "Start Menu" tab, click the "Classic Start
       menu" radio-button, and click "OK". <p>

       Alternatively, you can force My Computer to appear on your XP desktop
       by right-clicking on the desktop background and choosing "Properties".
       Select the "Desktop" tab and click "Customize Desktop..." to get the
       "Desktop Items" dialog.  Turn on the My Computer checkbox, then click
       "OK" twice.  </li>

  <li> There are several <b>Desktop icons</b> (i.e. "shortcuts") installed by
       default in the XP images: Computer Management, Bash and TCSH shells,
       and <i>NtEmacs</i>.  You will notice two flavors of Bash and TCSH icons
       on the desktop, labeled <code>rxvt</code> and <code>Cygwin</code>.
       
       <ul>

       <li> The <b><code>rxvt</code> shells</b> run in windows with
	    <b>X</b>-like cut-and-paste mouse clicks:

	    <ul>

	      <li> <b>Left-click</b> starts a selection,  </li>

	      <li> <b>Right-click</b> extends it, and  </li>

	      <li> <b>middle-click</b> pastes. </li>

	    </ul>

	    These are the ones to use if you're connecting from an X
	    workstation.  <p>

	    <b>NOTE:</b> The default colors used in Bash and rxvt don't work
	    well in 4-bit color mode under RDP.  Make sure you update your
	    rdp-mime.pl to get the rdesktop <b><code>-a 16</code></b> argument
	    for 16-bit color.  Or, you can over-ride the rxvt defaults by
	    putting lines in your <code>~/.Xdefaults</code> file like this:
	    <br> <code>rxvt*background: steelblue</code> </li> <br>

       <li> The <b><code>Cygwin</code> shells</b> run in a </b>Windows Terminal</b>
	    window, just as the Windows cmd.exe does.  These are the ones to use
	    if you're connecting from a Windows workstation.  <p>

	    <b>Quick-edit mode</b> is on by default, so you can cut-and-paste
	    freely between your local workstation desktop and your remote RDP
	    desktops. <p>

	    In a Windows Terminal window on your RDP remote desktop, the
	    quick-edit cut-and-paste mouse clicks are:

	    <ul>

	      <li> <b>Left-drag</b> the mouse to <i>mark</i> a rectangle 
		   of text, highlighting it.  </li>

	      <li> <b>Type <i>Enter</i> or <i>right-click</i> the mouse when text
		   is highlighted</b>, to <i>copy</i> the selected text to the
		   clipboard. (<b><i>Escape</i></b> <i>cancels</i> the selection
		   without copying it.)  </li>

	      <li> <b>Right-click the mouse with nothing selected</b> to 
		   <i>paste</i> the contents of the clipboard.  </li>

	    </ul>
       </ul>
  </li> <br>

  <li> On the <b>first login by a user</b>, Windows creates the user's <i>Windows
       profile directory</i> under <code>C:\Documents and Settings</code>, and creates
       the <i>registry key</i> (folder) for persistent settings for that user. <p>

       We arrange that early in the user's login process, a user <b>HOME</b>
       environment variable value is set in the user's registry.  Otherwise
       Emacs wouldn't know how to find your <i>.emacs</i> setup file in your
       remotely mounted home directory. <p>

       User "root" is special, and has a local home directory under
       <code>/home</code>.  <code>/home</code> is a Cygwin symbolic link to
       <code>C:\Documents and Settings</code>.
  </li>

  <li> The <i>Windows XP</i> Start menu has no <b>Shutdown</b> button under
       RDP.  Instead, it is labeled <b>Disconnect</b> and only closes the RDP
       client window, leaving the login session and the node running.  If you
       simply close the window, or the RDP client network connection is lost,
       you are also disconnected rather than logged out.  When you reconnect,
       it comes right back, just as it was. <p>

       To restart the computer, run <b>/sbin/reboot</b>, or use the "Shut
       Down" menu of <b>Task Manager</b>.  One way to start Task Manager is to
       right-click on the background of the Taskbar at the bottom of the
       screen and select "Task Manager".

<h4><a name="Custom_images"> </a> Making custom Windows OS images </h4>

Making custom Windows images is similar to <a
href="../tutorial/docwrapper.php3?docname=tutorial.html#CustomOS"> doing it on
the other Emulab operating systems</a>, except that you must do a little more
work to run the <code>prepare</code> script as user <code>root</code> since
there are no <code>su</code> or <code>sudo</code> commands on Windows.  This
is optional on the other OS types, but on Windows, proper TCP/IP network setup
depends on <code>prepare</code> being run.

<ul>
  <li>
    Log in to the node where you want to save a custom image.  Give
    the shell command to change the root password.  Pick a password
    string you can remember, typing it twice as prompted:
    <pre>
       % passwd root
       Enter the new password (minimum of 5, maximum of 8 characters).
       Please use a combination of upper and lower case letters and numbers.
       New password:
       Re-enter new password:
    </pre>

    This works becuase you are part of the Windows <code>Administrators</code>
    group.  Otherwise you would have to already know the root password to
    change it.  <p>

       <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <b>NOTE:</b> If you change the root
       password and reboot Windows before running <code>prepare</code> below,
       the root password will not match the definitions of the Emulab Windows
       services (daemons) that run as root, so they will not start up. </div>
  </li> <br>

  <li>
     Log out all sessions by users other than <code>root</code>, because
     <code>prepare</code> will be unable to remove their login profile
     directories if they are logged in.  (See <a href="#QWINSTA">QWINSTA</a>.)
  </li> <br>

  <li>
     Log in to the node as user <code>root</code> through the Console or SSH,
     using the password you set above, then run the <code>prepare</code> command.
     (It will print "Must be root to run this script!" and do nothing
     if not run as root.)
     <pre>
       /usr/local/etc/emulab/prepare
     </pre>
     
     If run without option arguments, <code>prepare</code> will ask for the
     root password you want to use in your new image, prompting twice as the
     passwd command did above.  It needs this to redefine the Emulab Windows
     services (daemons) that run as root.  It doesn't need to be the same as
     the root password you logged in with, since it sets the root password to
     be sure.  The Administrator password is changed as well, since the
     Sysprep option needs that (below.)  <p>

     <ul>
       <li>
         You can give the <b><code>-p</code></b> option to specify the root
	 password on the command line:
	 <pre>
	   /usr/local/etc/emulab/prepare -p myRootPwd
	 </pre>
       </li>
       <li>
	 The <b><code>-n</code></b> option says not to change the passwords at
	 all, and the Emulab Windows services are not redefined.
	 <pre>
	   /usr/local/etc/emulab/prepare -n
	 </pre>
       </li>
       <li>
	 The <b><code>-s</code></b> option is used to make
	 hardware-independent images using the Windows
	 <b><code>Sysprep</code></b> deploy tool.  If you use it with the
	 <code>-n</code> option instead of giving a password, it assumes that
	 you separately blank the Administrator password, or edit your
	 Administrator password into the
	 <code>[GuiUnattended]AdminPassword</code> entry of the sysprep.inf
	 file.
	 <pre>
	   /usr/local/etc/emulab/prepare -s -p myRootPwd
	 </pre>

	   <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <b>NOTE:</b> This must be done
	   from a login on the <b>serial console</b>, because Sysprep shuts
	   down the network.  <code>prepare -s</code> refuses to run from an
	   SSH or RDP login. </div> <br>

	 Windows normally casts some aspects of the NT image into concrete at
	 the first boot after installation, including the specific boot disk
	 driver to be used by the NT loader (IDE vs. SCSI.)
	 <code>Sysprep</code> is used by PC hardware manufacturers as they
	 make XP installation disks with their own drivers installed.  The
	 Sysprep option to run an unattended <code>Mini-Setup</code> at first
	 boot instead of the normal "Out Of the Box Experience" is used in
	 some large corporate roll-outs.  We do both. <p>

	 The Emulab <code> /share/windows/sysprep </code> directory contains
	 various service pack versions of the XP deploy tools, appropriate
	 device driver directories, and a draft sysprep.inf file to direct the
	 automated install process. <p>

	 Unfortunately, the cost of having just one WINXP image for all PC
	 types is that Mini-setup is slow, being a stripped-down NT kernel.
	 It also forces an additional reboot when it's finished installing
	 drivers.  Together, this adds between 4 and 5 minutes to the total
	 Windows swap-in time, increasing it from about 10 minutes to around
	 15.

	   <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <b>NOTE:</b> If you do this, set
	   the <b>reboot wait-time</b> as you create your Image Descriptor to
	   <b>360</b> rather than 240 so that swap-ins don't time out. </div>
	   <br>
       </li>

     </ul>
  </li>       

  <li>
     Then log out and <a
     href="../tutorial/docwrapper.php3?docname=tutorial.html#CustomOS">
     create your custom image.</a> <br>

       <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <b>NOTE:</b> Windows XP is too big to
       fit in the partitioning scheme used by FreeBSD and Linux, so it's
       necessary when making a Windows custom image to specify <b>Partition
       1</b>, and click <b>Whole Disk Image.</b> </div>

<h3><a name="Cygwin"> </a> Cygwin </h3>

Cygwin is <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/"> GNU + Cygnus + Windows </a>,
providing Linux-like functionality at the API, command-line, and package
installation levels. <p>

<h4><a name="Cygwin_documentation"> </a> Cygwin documentation </h4>

Cygwin is well documented.  Here are some links to get you started:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/cygwin-ug-net.html"> 
    Users guide </a> </li>

    API compatibility and Cygwin functions </a> </li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Cygwin_packages"> </a> Cygwin packages </h4>

A number of optional Cygwin packages are installed in the image due to our
building and running the Emulab client software, plus some editors for
convenience.  These packages are currently agetty, bison, cvs, cygrunsrv, ed,
file, flex, gcc, gdb, inetutils, make, minires-devel, more, nano, openssh,
openssl-devel, patch, perl, perl-libwin32, psmisc, python, rpm, rsync,
shutdown, sysvinit, tcsh, vim, wget, and zip. <p>

The Cygwin command <b><code>cygcheck -c</code></b> lists the packages that are
installed, and their current version number and status.

Package-specific notes and/or documentation for installed packages are in
<code>/usr{,/share}/doc/Cygwin/*.README</code> and
<code>/usr/share/doc/*/README</code> files.

The <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/packages/"> Cygwin package site </a> lists
the available pre-compiled packages and provides a search engine. <p>

If you want to install more Cygwin pre-compiled packages, run the graphical
installer: <pre>    C:/Software/Cygwin/setup.exe</pre>  <p>

The Cygwin command <b><code>cygcheck -l <i>package-name</i></code></b> lists the
contents of an installed package, which may help you to make a tarfile or rpm
from a package you have installed.  You can then cause it to be installed
automatically by Emulab into all of the nodes of your experiment.  See the <a
href="../tutorial/docwrapper.php3?docname=tutorial.html#TARBALLS">
Tutorial </a> for more information about installing RPM's and tarballs. <p>

Watch out for post-install scripts in:
<pre>    /etc/postinstall/<i>package-name</i>.sh{,.done}</pre><p>

Many packages not in the Cygwin package site have also been ported to Cygwin
already.  Download the sources to an experiment node and try
<pre>
    ./configure
    make
    make install
</pre> as usual. <p>

<h4><a name="SMB_mounts"> </a> SMB mounts and Samba </h4>

User home directories and other shared directories are served by <b>fs</b>,
another alias for Ops/Users, via the SMB protocol (Server Message Block, also
known as Windows File Sharing) with the Windows Client connecting to the Samba
server. <p>

UNC paths with leading double-slashes <b><code>//fs</code></b> are used to
access the SMB Shares under Cygwin.  They are then further mounted to the
usual Unix paths for the shared directories:
<code>/users/&lt;username&gt;</code>, <code>/proj/&lt;pid&gt;</code>,
<code>/group/&lt;pid&gt;/&lt;gid&gt;</code>, and <code>/share</code>.
<p>

The Cygwin <b><code>mount</code></b> command lists what you could access on
the Samba server, with the UNC path in the first column.  Unix file
permissions may further limit your access on the Samba server.  Log in to Ops
to investigate.<p>

<b><code>/share/windows</code></b> contains Windows software.  See
<code>/share/windows/README.bin</code> for descriptions of binary packages
available for installation. <p>

In Windows GUI programs, you can just type the UNC path into the Address bar
or a file-open dialog with <b>backslashes</b>, e.g. <code>\\fs\share</code> or
<code>\\fs\&lt;username&gt;</code>.  User and project shares are marked "not
browsable", so just <code>\\fs</code> shows only <code>share</code>. <p>

Windows limitation: There is only one protection mask for everything in a
whole mount/share under SMB.  It's set in the "share properties" on the server
(Samba config file in this case) so <b><code>chmod</code></b> will do you no
good across SMB.

<h4><a name="Cygwin_arcana"> </a> Cygwin arcana </h4>

<ul>

  <li> Paths <p>

       Cygwin accepts either flavor of slashes in paths, Unix/POSIX-style
       forward-slashes, or Windows-style back-slashes.  In Unix shell
       commands, backslashes need to be quoted. <p>

       Single-quotes work best.  Doubling each backslash also works.  This
       must also be done inside double-quotes.  Examples:
       <code>'\single\quoted'</code>, <code>"\\double\\quoted"</code>,
       <code>\\un\\quoted</code>.  (The difference between double and single
       quotes is that $variable references and back-quoted command execution
       are expanded in double-quotes.) <p>

       When you invoke Windows (as opposed to Cygwin) commands, for example
       <b><code>net use</code></b>, they will know nothing about Unix-style paths in
       their arguments. The <a
       href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-utils.html#cygpath">
       <b><code>cygpath</code></b> </a> utility is an aid to converting paths
       between the Unix and Windows conventions. <p>

       <code>cygpath -w</code> converts its arguments to Windows format, where <code>cygpath
       -u</code> converts its arguments to Unix format, e.g. <pre>
	 $ cygpath -w /cygdrive/c/WINDOWS
	 c:\WINDOWS

	 $ cygpath -u 'c:\WINDOWS'
	 /cygdrive/c/WINDOWS
	 </pre> <p>  </li>

  <li> Cygwin mounts <p>

       <a href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-utils.html#mount">
       Cygwin mount points </a> are shown by the <b><code>mount</code></b> and
       <b><code>df</code></b> commands.   <p>

       Note that there is a hard-coded limit of 30 mount points in Cygwin.
       Attempts to use the Cygwin <code>mount</code> command after that will
       fail. <p>

       We discussed UNC <code>//machine</code> paths to SMB shares <a
       href="#SMB_mounts"> above </a>. <p>

       Another special case is the <b>Unix root</b>, "<code>/</code>".  It's
       mounted to <code>C:\cygwin</code> in the Windows filesystem. </li>

  <li> Windows drive letter mounts <p>

       Cygwin knows about drive letter prefixes like
       <b><code>C:</code></b>&nbsp;, which are equivalent to
       <code>/cygdrive/&lt;drive-letter&gt;</code>&nbsp;.  However,
       <code>/cygdrive</code>, like <code>/dev</code>, isn't a real directory,
       so you can't <code>ls</code> it.  <p>

       Some Windows software requires drive-letter mounts to be created for
       its use. <p>

       You can use the Windows <b><code>net use</code></b> command to
       associate drive letters with UNC paths to SMB shares, e.g. <pre>net
       use W: '\\fs\share\windows'</pre> <p>

       You can use the Windows <b><code>subst</code></b> command to associate
       drive letters with local paths, e.g. <code>subst T: 'C:\Temp'</code> <p>

       Filename completion in Cygwin shells with <code>&lt;Tab&gt;</code>
       doesn't work following a drive-letter prefix, but it works normally
       after a <code>/cygdrive/</code> prefix.  Also, filename completion is
       case-sensitive, although the underlying Windows is case-insensitive, so
       a filename in the wrong case is still opened properly. </li>

  <li> Cygwin is running in <a
       href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/ntsec.html"> <b>NTSEC</b> </a>
       (NT Security) mode, so <code>/etc/passwd</code> and
       <code>/etc/group</code> contain Windows SID's as user and group ID's.
       Your Windows UID is the computer SID with a user number appended,
       something like
       <code>S-1-5-21-2000478354-436374069-1060284298-1334</code>. <p>

       Cygwin commands, such as <code>id</code>, <code>ls -ln</code>, and
       <code>chown/chgrp</code>, use the numeric suffix as the uid,
       e.g. <code>1334</code>.  This is different from your normal Emulab Unix
       user ID number, and the Samba server takes care of the
       difference. <p>

       The <b><code>id</code></b> command reports your user id and group
       memberships.  <p>

       Note that all users are in group <b><code>None</code></b> on XP.
       Contrary to the name, this is a group that contains <b>all users</b>.
       It was named <code>Everybody</code> on Windows 2000, which was a better
       name.  </li>

  <li> There is no direct equivalent of the Unix <b>setuid</b> programs under
       Windows, and hence no <code>su</code> or <code>sudo</code> commands. <p>

       The Windows equivalent to running a Unix command as <code>root</code>
       is membership in the Windows <b><code>Administrators</code></b> group.
       Emulab project members who have either <code>local_root</code> or
       <code>group_root</code> privileges are put in group
       <b><code>wheel</code></b>, another alias for
       <code>Administrators</code>.  Project members with <code>user</code>
       privileges are not members of the wheel group. <p>

       You can <code>ssh</code> a command to the node as the target user, as
       long as you arrange for the proper authentication.  <p>

       There is not usually a Windows account named <b><code>root</code></b>.
       We create one as part of the Emulab setup to own installed software,
       and to run services and Unix scripts that check that they're running
       with root privileges.  The <code>root</code> user does not have Samba
       privileges to access Samba shared mounts, including <code>/proj</code>,
       <code>/groups</code>, and <code>/users</code>.  <p>

       For C/C++ code, there is a <code>setuid()</code> function in the Cygwin
       library, which "impersonates" the user if proper setup is done first.
       </li>

  <li> Cygwin does a pretty good job of mapping Unix user-group-other file
       permissions to Windows NT security ACLs.  <p>

       On Windows, unlike Unix, file permissions can lock out root,
       Administrator, or SYSTEM user access.  Many Unix scripts don't bother
       with permissions if they're running as root, and hence need
       modification to run on Cygwin. </li>

  <li> Cygwin tries to treat <code>.exe</code> files the same as executable
       files without the <code>.exe</code> suffix, but with execute
       permissions turned on.  This breaks down in Makefile actions and
       scripts, where <code>rm</code>, <code>ls -l</code>, and
       <code>install</code> commands may need an explicit <code>.exe</code>
       added. </li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="NtEmacs"> </a> NtEmacs </h3>

We don't include the Cygwin X server in our XP images to keep the bulk and
complexity down.  So <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html"> <i>NtEmacs</i>
21.3 </a> is provided instead of the Cygwin <b>X</b> Emacs.  <i>NtEmacs</i>
"frames" are windows on the Windows Desktop, e.g. <code>^X-5-2</code> makes
another one. <p>

The <code>/usr/local/bin/emacs</code> executable is a symlink to
<code>/cygdrive/c/emacs-21.3/bin/runemacs.exe</code>, which starts up an Emacs
on the desktop.  This only works under RDP, since SSH logins have a null
desktop. <p>

There is also a <code>/usr/local/bin/emacs-exe</code> executable, a symlink to
<code>/cygdrive/c/emacs-21.3/bin/emacs.exe</code>, which is only useful as an
Emacs compiler.  It could be used to run Emacs in an SSH or Serial Console 
login window with the
<code>-nw</code> (no windows) flag, except that it exits with <code>emacs:
standard input is not a tty</code>.  Another thing not to try is running
<code>emacs-exe -nw</code> in a Bash or TCSH shell on the RDP desktop.  It
crashed <i>Windows XP</i> when I tried it. <p>

<ul>

  <li> Can drag-and-drop files from <i>Windows Explorer</i> to <i>NtEmacs</i>

<h3><a name="Changes"> </a> Change Log </h3>

<b>2006-02-14</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    The -UPDATE images include the most recent round of Microsoft patches,
    plugging both known WMF holes and many others.  The -SP* images of course
    <b>don't</b> have the WMF holes plugged, but that's no different from before.
  </li><br>

  <li>
    When making <a href="#Custom_images">custom Windows images</a>, the
    <code>prepare</code> script now requires you to set your own
    <code>root</code> password.
  </li><br>

  <li>
    Within the Emulab code, these images restore linktest to working condition.
  </li><br>

  <li>
    The other changes are intended to make Windows booting and setup more reliable.

    One is that sshd is turned off during rc.bootsetup, since it would
    sometimes go into a loop, eating the CPU and preventing setup from
    finishing before timing out.  Unless you're logging in as root, it won't
    do you much good to try to log in before accounts are set up anyway...  In
    case of trouble, log in via RDP or the serial console, and say "net start
    sshd" in a shell.
  </li><br>

  <li>
    I've also been chasing a random problem where one of the network
    interfaces disappears from ipconfig due to a race condition within Windows
    startup.  rc.cygwin/rc.ifconfig now work harder at resetting the
    interfaces, and reboot as a last resort if that fails.  It seems that
    fixing one interface can make the problem move to another one though.
    Unless you use all four available experimental network interfaces in an
    experiment topology, this should fix the problem.
  </li>
</ul>

<b>2005-11-22</b>
<ul>
  <li>

<b>2005-8-22</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Everything created behind control-net firewalls to avoid contamination.

  <li> Use Sysprep (MS WADS) for multi-hardware XP images. </li>

  <li> Automate production of <i>Windows XP</i> images for Emulab. </li>

  <li> Dynamic routing support for <code>rtproto Session</code>?  </li>

</ul>
