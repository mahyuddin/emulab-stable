<h3><a name="Overview"> </a> Overview </h3>

Microsoft Windows XP is now supported as one of the operating system types for
experiment nodes in Emulab, in addition to FreeBSD and Linux.

Before booting the node at swap-in time, Emulab loads a fresh image of Windows
XP onto the experiment nodes in parallel, using our Frisbee service.  Emulab
software automatically configures each Windows XP node, providing the expected
experiment user environment including: user accounts and Emulab SSH keys; remote
home, project, and shared directories; and network connections.  <p>

The Cygwin GNU environment is provided, including Bash and TCSH shells, the
C/C++, Perl and Python programming languages, and several editors including
Emacs, vim, nano and ed.  <p>

The Emulab web interface manages a separate Windows password in the user
profile, as well as making SSH and RDP login connections to the experiment nodes.
Remote Desktop Protocol service supports Windows Desktop logins from the
user's workstation screen to the experiment node.  <p>

Windows XP installations are more hardware dependent than Linux or FreeBSD.
At first, this Windows XP image only runs on the pc850 and pc600 Emulab node
types.  <p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h3><a name="Differences"></a> Differences from FreeBSD and Linux in Emulab </h3>

The biggest difference of course, is that this is <b>Windows</b> (!), with
Cygwin layered on top, in an Emulab context.  In particular, this is Windows
XP (NT 5.1), with various levels of service packs and updates (see <a
href="#Experiment_setup">below</a>.) <p>

The second-biggest difference is that shared directories are provided not by
the NFS (Network File System) protocol, but instead by the <b>SMB</b> (Server
Message Block) protocol, otherwise known as Windows File Sharing.  The Client
for Microsoft Networks software contacts the SMB server, in this case
<b>Samba</b> running on the file server known as <b>Fs</b>.  The SMB protocol
authenticates using a plain-text user name and password, encrypted as they go
across the network.  (These Windows Shares are then accessed by UNC paths
under Cygwin mounts, described below.) <p>

<h4><a name="Windows_Passwords"> </a> Windows Passwords </h4>

A separate <b>Windows password</b> is kept for use only with experiment nodes
running Windows.  It will eventually be presented behind-the-scenes to
rdesktop and Samba by our Web interface.  Meanwhile, you will need to type it
on each connection. <p>

The default Windows password is randomly generated.  It's easy to change it to
something easier to remember. <p>

To see or edit your Windows password, log in to Emulab, and click <b>Manage
User Profile</b> and then <b>Edit Profile under User Options</b>.  You
will see <b>Windows Password</b> fields in addition to the regular Emulab
<b>Password</b> fields. <p>

When you change your Windows password, you will also have to re-type it as a
check.  The new Windows password should propagate to the Samba server on Fs
instantly, so you can swap in an experiment and log in to its Windows nodes
with the new password. <p>

If you have already swapped-in experiment nodes and change your Windows
password, the account information including passwords will be updated at the
next Emulab watchdog daemon isalive interval.  This should be in 3 to 6
minutes. <p>

<h4><a name="Experiment_setup"> </a> Experiment setup for Windows nodes. </h4>

All you have to do is put a line specifying a WINXP OS image in your
experiment .ns file, like this: <br>
<pre>    tb-set-node-os $node WINXP-02-16</pre>

Currently available images are:

<ul>

  <li><b>WINXP-02-11</b> - Windows XP-SP1, pc600 and pc850, release
  candidate.</li>

  <li><b>WINXP-02-16</b> - Windows XP-SP2+, pc600 and pc850, release
  candidate.  This incorporates SP2, as well as all "critical" and "security"
  updates as of the date of the image. </li>

</ul>

Note: routing is not currently supported on Windows.  Don't put any
<b>rtproto</b> statements in your .ns file.  <p>

Notice that Windows reboots an extra time after first swap-in on a node, after
changing the node name, to set up the network stack properly.   <p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <b>NOTE:</b> Sometimes we have seen Windows
XP fail to do the second reboot.  We're working on it.  If you try to login
after swap-in and your Windows password isn't honored, use this command on Ops
to remotely reboot the node:<pre>    node_reboot pcxxx</pre>

If you are able to log in but your remote home directory isn't mounted, you
have the additional option of executing this command on
the node itself: <pre>    /sbin/reboot</pre> </div>

<h4><a name="Login_connections"> </a> Login connections to Windows. </h4>

You can manually start up SSH or RDP client programs to connect and log in to
nodes in your experiment, using your Windows password. <p>

Or you can set up your browser to automatically connect in one click from the
Emulab web interface.  Once an experiment is swapped in, the Emulab Experiment
Information page contains a table of the physical node ID and logical node
name, status, and connection buttons.  The captions of the button columns link
to pages explaining how to set up up mime-types in your browser to make the
buttons work, from FreeBSD, Linux, and Windows workstations:

<ul>
       
  <li> <a href="https://www.emulab.net/docwrapper.php3?docname=ssh-mime.html">
       <b>SSH</b> </a> - The <b>SSH</b> connection button gives a Bash or TCSH
       shell, as usual.  Although your Emulab ssh keys are installed on the
       node in a /sshkeys subdirectory, you have to type your password to SSH
       logins to enable remote directory mounts through SMB.  </li>

  <li> <a href="https://www.emulab.net/faq.php3#UTT-TUNNEL"> <b>Console</b>
       </a> - The <b>Console</b> button won't do much good now, because
       Windows doesn't normally provide logins on the com serial device.
       (This will be remedied with <i>agetty</i> eventually.)  An exception is
       that you can monitor the Frisbee loading of the Windows image on the
       console.  </li>

  <li> <a href="https://www.emulab.net/docwrapper.php3?docname=rdp-mime.html">
       <b>RDP</b> </a> - The <b>RDP</b> button starts up a Remote Desktop
       Protocol connection, giving a Windows Desktop login from the user's
       workstation screen to the experiment node.  The "rdesktop" client
       software is used from Linux and Unix client workstations.  A Microsoft
       RDC (Remote Desktop Connector) client program is included in Windows
       XP, and may be installed onto other versions of Windows as well.  </li> 

</ul>

<h4><a name="RDP_details"> </a> RDP details </h4>

Here are some fine points and hints for RDP logins to remote Windows desktops:

<ul>

  <li> Microsoft allows only <b>one desktop login at a time</b> to Windows XP,
       although this is the same Citrix Hydra technology that supports many
       concurrent logins to Terminal Server or Server 2003. <p>

       The <b>Fast User Switching</b> option to XP is turned on, so a second
       RDP connection disconnects a previous one rather than killing it.
       Similarly, just closing your RDP client window disconnects your Windows
       Login session rather than killing it. You can reconnect later on
       without losing anything. <p>

       SSH doesn't count as a desktop, so you can ssh in and use this command:
       <pre> qwinsta</pre> (Query WINdows STAtion) command to show existing
       winstation sessions and their session ID's, and this one to reset
       (kill) a session by ID: <pre> rwinsta</pre> </li>

  <li> We rename <b>My Computer</b> to show the PCxxx physical node name, but
       it doesn't appear on the Windows XP desktop by default.  The XP user
       interface incorporates My Computer into the upper-right quadrant of the
       Start menu by default, and removes it from the desktop. <p>

       You can go back to the "classic" user interface of Windows 2000,
       including showing My Computer.  Right-click on the background of the
       Taskbar which contains the Start button at the left, and choose
       "Properties".  Select the "Start Menu" tab, click the "Classic Start
       menu" radio-button, and click "OK". <p>

       Alternatively, you can force My Computer to appear on your XP desktop
       by right-clicking on the desktop background and choosing "Properties".
       Select the "Desktop" tab and click "Customize Desktop..." to get the
       "Desktop Items" dialog.  Turn on the My Computer checkbox, then click
       "OK" twice.  </li>

  <li> There are several <b>Desktop icons</b> (i.e. "shortcuts") installed by
       default in the XP images: Computer Management, Bash and TCSH shells,
       and NtEmacs.  </li> <br>
       
  <li> The Bash and TCSH icons run their respective shells in a </b>Windows
       Terminal</b>, just like the Windows cmd.exe .  <p>

       <b>Quick-edit mode</b> is on by default, so you can cut-and-paste
       freely between your local workstation desktop and your remote RDP
       desktops. <p>

       Remember that the cut-and-paste mouse clicks are different from in
       <b>X</b>, where left-click starts a selection, right-click extends it,
       and middle-click pastes.  (These are the clicks to use when you are
       SSH'ed in to a Windows node from an xterm window.)  Yes, it can be
       confusing. <p>

       In a Windows Terminal window on your RDP remote desktop, the
       cut-and-paste mouse clicks are:

       <ul>

         <li> <b>Left-drag</b> the mouse to <i>mark</i> a rectangle 
	      of text, highlighting it.  </li>
       
         <li> <b>Type <i>Enter</i> or <i>right-click</i> the mouse when text
	      is highlighted</b>, to <i>copy</i> the selected text to the
	      clipboard. (<b><i>Escape</i></b> <i>cancels</i> the selection
	      without copying it.)  </li>
       
	 <li> <b>Right-click the mouse with nothing selected</b> to 
	      <i>paste</i> the contents of the clipboard.  </li>

       </ul> <br>

  <li> On the <b>first login by a user</b>, Windows creates the user's <i>Windows
       profile directory</i> under "C:\Documents and Settings", and creates
       the <i>registry key</i> (folder) for persistent settings for that user. <p>

       We arrange that early in the user's login process, a user <b>HOME</b>
       environment variable value is set in the user's registry.  Otherwise
       Emacs wouldn't know how to find your <i>.emacs</i> setup file in your
       remotely mounted home directory. <p>

       User "root" is special, and has a local home directory under /home.
       /home is a Cygwin symbolic link to "C:\Documents and Settings".  </li>

  <li> The Windows XP Start menu has no <b>Shutdown</b> button under RDP.
       Instead, it is labeled <b>Disconnect</b> and only closes the RDP client
       window, leaving the login session and the node running. <p>

       To restart the computer, run <b>/sbin/reboot</b>, or use the "Shut
       Down" menu of <b>Task Manager</b>.  One way to start Task Manager is to
       right-click on the background of the Taskbar at the bottom of the
       screen and select it. </li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="Cygwin"> </a> Cygwin </h3>

Cygwin is <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/"> GNU + Cygnus + Windows </a>,
providing Linux-like functionality at the API, command-line, and package
installation levels. <p>

<h4><a name="Cygwin_packages"> </a> Cygwin packages </h4>

A number of optional Cygwin packages are installed in the image due to our
building and running the Emulab client software, plus some editors for
convenience.  These packages are currently agetty, bison, cvs, cygrunsrv, ed,
file, flex, gcc, gdb, make, nano, openssh, openssl-devel, patch, perl,
perl-libwin32, python, rpm, rsync, shutdown, tcsh, vim, wget, and zip. <p>

The <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/packages/"> Cygwin package site </a> lists
the available pre-compiled packages and provides a search engine. <p>

If you want to install more Cygwin pre-compiled packages, run the graphical
installer: <pre>    C:/Software/Cygwin/cygwin-setup.exe</pre>  <p>

The Cygwin command <pre>    cygcheck -l <i>package-name</i></pre> lists the
contents of an installed package, which may help you to make a tarfile from a
package you have installed, which will then installed automatically by Emulab
into all of the nodes of your experiment.  See the <a
href="http://www.emulab.net/tutorial/docwrapper.php3?docname=tutorial.html#TARBALLS">
Tutorial  </a> for more information. <p>

Watch out for post-install scripts in:
<pre>    /etc/postinstall/<i>package-name</i>.sh{,.done}</pre><p>

Many packages not in the Cygwin package site have also been ported to Cygwin
already.  Download the sources to an experiment node and try
<pre>
    configure
    make
    make install
</pre> as usual. <p>

<h4><a name="SMB_mounts"> </a> SMB mounts and Samba </h4>

Some details remain to be documented: <br>

<pre>
       - Home dirs are on //fs via SMB(Windows Client, Samba server)
         . cygwin/UNC mounts of Windows Shares under /users, /proj, /share.
         . Can put \\fs\<share_name> into the Windows Explorer "Address"

       - Shared directories: /share, /project/pid, /group/<pid>/<gid>

       - Bug: One protection mask for everything in a whole mount/share under SMB.
</pre>

<h4><a name="Cygwin_arcana"> </a> Cygwin arcana </h4>

<pre>
       - Paths 
         . \ == / modulo quoting
         . cygpath -w, cygpath -u
         . UNC paths: //machine

       - Cygwin mounts
         . Shown in the "mount" and "df" commands.
         . / == C:/cygwin
         . /cygdrive/c == C:
         . //fs/... all Emulab directories.

       - /etc/{passwd,group} contain Windows SID's as UID's and GID's.

       -  No suid, but everybody is in group wheel==Administrators.

       - File protections can lock out root, Administrator, or SYSTEM.
</pre>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h3><a name="NtEmacs"> </a> NtEmacs </h3>

We don't include the Cygwin X server in our XP images to keep the bulk and
complexity down.  So <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html"> NtEmacs 21.3
</a> is provided instead of the Cygwin X Emacs.  NtEmacs "frames" are windows
on the Windows Desktop. <p>

The /usr/local/bin/emacs executable is a symlink to
/cygdrive/c/emacs-21.3/bin/runemacs.exe, which starts up an Emacs on the desktop.
This only works under RDP, since SSH logins have a null desktop. <p>

There is also a /usr/local/bin/emacs-exe executable, a symlink to
/cygdrive/c/emacs-21.3/bin/emacs.exe, which is only useful as an Emacs
compiler.  It could be used to run Emacs in an SSH window with the -nw (no
windows) flag, except that it exits with "emacs: standard input is not a tty".
Another thing not to try is running "emacs-exe -nw" in a Bash or TCSH shell on
the RDP desktop.  It crashes Windows XP. <p>

<pre>
       - Can drag-and-drop files from Windows Explorer to NtEmacs windows.

       - cygmount.el makes Cygwin mounts visible within Emacs.

       - Options - See ~root/.emacs
         . mouse-wheel-mode
         . CUA mode option (^C copy / ^X cut on selection, ^V paste, ^Z undo).
</pre>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h3><a name="Future"> </a> Future work </h3>

There are still some things left to do: <br>

<pre>
       - The Elvin event system, and hence progagent, is not yet running.

       - syncerver, slothd and healthd.

       - Password and ssh keys both working (hopefully.)

       - Console support (agetty serial line speed 115.2kb doesn't work)

       - No such thing as load averages, see the Task Manager/Performance tab.

       - Automate production of Windows XP images for Emulab.
</pre>
