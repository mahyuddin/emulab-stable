<a NAME="machines"></a><h2>Machines and Interfaces</h2>
<p>
The "pc2000" machines are
<a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/ws340/en/index.htm">
Dell Precision Workstation 340s</a>
with a single 2GHz processor, 512MB of RAMBUS RAM, and 2 7,200&nbsp;RPM 20GB IDE disks.
Each has 4 available 100Mb experimental net interfaces in the form of 2
dual port Intel Pro/100 PCI cards.
</p><p>
Each node also has a single Intel IXP1200 Network Processor in the form of
an ENP2505 (Bridalveil) card.
See the
<a href="../tutorial/docwrapper.php3?docname=ixp.html">
Emulab IXP document</a> for details on how these are integrated into Emulab.
</p><p>
All machines have serial console lines accessible from users.emulab.net via
the "console" command or remotely via the
<a href="http://www.emulab.net/kb-show.php3?xref_tag=tiptunnel">tiptunnel</a> interface.
</p>
<a NAME="images"></a><h2>Images and Kernel Support</h2>
<p>
Currently, the Emulab standard FreeBSD images prior to FreeBSD 7
(FBSD410-STD, FBSD54-STD, FBSD61-STD),
and Linux images (RHL90-STD, FC4-STD, "legacy" RHL73-STD)
will run on these machines.
</p><p>
<b>NOTE:</b> at this time, only the RHL73-IXPHOST image has IXP support.
The IXP will be ignored in all other kernels
(see <a href="#caveats">Caveats</a> below).
</p><p>
For custom images, no special drivers are needed
if you do not want to use the IXP devices.
</p>
<a NAME="caveats"></a><h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Windows does not run on these nodes.</b>
     We have never been able to make a Windows system work on these,
     possibly because of the IXP cards.
<li> <b>FreeBSD 7 does not run on these nodes.</b>
     It blows up in the ACPI code during booting.  It also blows up at
     boot time if ACPI is disabled.  Again, possibly because of the IXP
     cards.
<li> <b>Access to the second disk is slower than to the primary disk.</b>
     This is due to the second disk being connected to the primary IDE
     controller "slave" rather than the secondary IDE "master."
     <b>NOTE:</b> at this time, pc170 <i>does</i> have the second drive connected
     to the master.
</ul>
