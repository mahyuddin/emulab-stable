     <h3>Introduction</h3>

The mobile wireless testbed integrates robots and motes into the standard
Emulab testbed.  If you want to know how to create experiments utilizing these
resources, check out the <a href="/tutorial/mobilewireless.php3">tutorial</a>.
This document is intended to provide an in-depth description of what makes up
this part of Emulab.

<p>
<li> <a NAME="HARDWARE"></a>
     <h3>Hardware</h3>

The hardware systems that make up the mobile wireless testbed are:

<ul>
<li>Four Acroname <a
href="http://www.acroname.com/garcia/garcia.html">Garcia</a> robots.
<li><a href="http://www.xbow.com/Products/XScale.htm">Intel Stargate</a> single
board computers for each robot.
<li><a href="http://www.xbow.com/Products/productsdetails.aspx?sid=72">Mica2 
motes</a> attached to each stargate.
<li>Four overhead cameras for <a href="#VISION">visual tracking</a> of the
robots.
<li>A <a href="/webcam.php3">webcam</a> for viewing the robots in their
habitat.
</ul>

<p>
<li> <a NAME="VISION"></a>
     <h3>Tracking Cameras</h3>

Tracking the robots in physical space is done by identifying colored circles on
top of each robot using four video cameras mounted overhead.  Because of the
reliance on visual tracking, the robots must stay within the cameras view of
the world.  The viewable area for each camera can be seen on the <a
href="/robotmap.php3">robot map</a> by selecting the "Show Tracking Camera
Bounds" display option.

<p>
<li> <a NAME="NAVIGATION"></a>
     <h3>Robot Navigation</h3>

Due to physical obstacles in the robot area and the size and maneuverability of
the robots, there are limitations on where the robots can go and how they can
get there.

</ul>
