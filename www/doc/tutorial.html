    <h1>Utah Network Testbed - Tutorial</h1>
    <h3>First of all</h3>
    <p>
      First of all, 
      to make sure you have
      a working account 
      on 
      the Utah Network Testbed, log in 
      via the 
      <a href="https://www.emulab.net/tbdb.html">Testbed Web Interface.</a>
      If you do not have 
      an account, don't worry-- 
      the login page 
      contains 
      detailed information about obtaining 
      and 
      verifying 
      an account.
    </p>
    <h3>Designing a Network Topology</h3>
    <p>
      The Utah Network Testbed's power lies in its ability to assume many
      different topologies; the description of a such a topology is a necessary
      part of an experiment. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Utah Network Testbed uses the "NS" ("Network Simulator")
      format to describe network topologies. 
      This is substantially the same format used by 
      <a href="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/">ns-2</a>.
      Since the Utah Network Testbed interface doesn't interpret these
      files directly with
      <a href="http://www.scriptics.com/software/tcltk/">Tcl</a>,
      some functionality may work differently than you expect, or not at all.
      If you feel there is useful functionality missing, please let us know. 
      Also, some 
      <a href="tbcommands.html">testbed-specific commands</a> 
      have been added. These begin with "#TB"; 
      they will be ignored as comments by ns utilities outside of the testbed.
      In short, most NS files should work on both the Testbed and ns-2, most 
      of the time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For those unfamiliar with the NS format, here is an example.
      Let's say we are trying to create a test network which looks like
      the following:
      <br>
      <img src="vlanpic.png">
      <br>
      (A is connected to B, B to C, and B to D.)
      <br>
      An NS file which would describe such connectivity is as follows:
    </p>
<pre>
# begin example.ns

# This is a simple ns script. Comments start with #.
set ns [new Simulator]

# First, define some nodes.
set A [$ns node]
set B [$ns node]
set C [$ns node]
set D [$ns node]

# Second, make some links between them, specifying
# bandwidth, latency, and queue type
$ns duplex-link $A $B 100Mb 10ms DropTail
$ns duplex-link $B $C 100Mb 10Ms DropTail
$ns duplex-link $B $D 100Mb 10Ms DropTail

# If you are running FreeBSD or Linux on any nodes 
# you can set the IP addresses like this:
#  #TB set-ip-interface   
# For instance, the next line sets the IP address of B on the port going to C:

#TB set-ip-interface B C 192.168.42.42

# Note: The initial '#' is required to insure that 'ns'
# will ignore these testbed-only commands.

# The Testbed software will choose IP addresses for you, but you can choose
# them if you prefer. It is generally a good idea to have every link from
# any given node be on a different subnet, and to have both ends of a link
# on the same subnet.

$ns run

# end example.ns
</pre>
    </p>    

    <h3>Beginning the Experiment</h3>
    <p>
      After logging on and validating to the Testbed Web Interface,
      choose "Begin an Experiment." Fill in the Name and Long Name fields.
      In the "Your NS file" field, place the <i>local path</i> of a NS file
      which you have created to describe your network topology. This file
      will be uploaded through your browser when you choose "Submit." 
    </p>
    <p>
      After submission, the testbed interface will begin processing your
      request. This could take a few minutes, depending on how many nodes you 
      are using and what other features (such as delay nodes and bandwidth limits)
      you are using. Once processing is done, the interface will present you with
      a list of nodes allocated for the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use the above .NS file, you should get a set of allocated nodes similar
      to this (physical machine names will likely be different:)
    </p>

</pre>
    <p>
      Notice that three "delay nodes" have been allocated to accomodate the 
      10ms delay time, as specified in the .NS file.   
    </p>

    <h3>So now you have your nodes...</h3>

    <h4>Logging in</h4>
    <p>
      Once nodes have been allocated for an experiment, they are rebooted,
      and all members of your Project are given login accounts.
      Your username and password for testbed machines 
      will be the same as the one you use on the web interface. 
      Use ssh to log into "ops.emulab.net". If your machine, as configured, supports
      ssh, you can "ssh <i>machinename</i>" into one of your machines 
      ("tbpc15" is one such machine in the above example.) 
      If you are concerned about ssh traffic interfering with an experiment, 
      or if you have configured a machine to run an operating system which does not
      support incoming ssh connections, an alternative is 
      "tip <i>machinename</i>", which communicates directly with a machine's
      serial port. The standard FreeBSD and Linux installations listen for logins
      on this port. 
   </p>
   <p>
      Once you are logged in, use "sudo" to run commands as root.
   </p>
   
   <h4>Powercycling Nodes</h4>
   <p>
     Nodes may be rebooted or powered off using local commands on the
     machine, if available. In addition, machines are connected to a power controller,
     accessable through "ops.emulab.net". 
     While logged into ops, 
     use the commands "power on <i>machinename</i>", "power off <i>machinename</i>", and
     "power cycle <i>machinename</i>" to control power to your nodes. 
   </p>
   <h4>Reconfiguring Node Operating Systems</h4>
   <p>
     Each PC on the testbed has three hard disk partitions. 
     One partition contains Redhat Linux 6.2, another FreeBSD 4.0, and the last
     can be loaded with any suitable operating system.
     Unless specified otherwise in the .NS file, normal nodes will default to Linux, while
     delay nodes will default to FreeBSD. If a delay node's operating system is changed to 
     to something other than FreeBSD, it will not function as a delay node.
   </p>
   <p>
     Node operating systems can be initially configured using the following command 
     in a .NS file: 
   </p>
     "#TB <a href="nscommands.html#set-node-os">set-node-os</a> <i>nodename</i> <i>imagename</i>"
     <br>
     <i>nodename</i> is the machine name you're using in your NS file.
     <br>
     <i>imagename</i> is "RHL62-STD", "FBSD40-STD", or an image of your own devising.
   <p>
       Node operating systems can also be changed while an experiment is underway,
       via the www.emulab.net web interface. Go to the 
       "Experiment Information" page, select your experiment, then select the 
       name of a machine from the list of those allocated for that experiment.
       This will bring up the Node Control Center. 
       In the box labeled "Def boot image" choose "RHL62-STD" or "FBSD40-STD", 
       or an image of your own devising (this is documented elsewhere.) 
       Submit the change, and if all goes well, the node will be reconfigured.
       The changes will take effect next time the machine is rebooted.
