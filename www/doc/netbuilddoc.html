<h1>Introduction to Netbuild</h1>
<h2>Basic usage:</h2>
<list>
<li>To create a Node, click and drag the "new node" icon in the
palette (the left panel) to the work area (the middle panel.)</li>
<p>
<li>To link two nodes together, click one node, then hold "ctrl" and
click the node you want to link it to.</li>
<p>
<li>To create a LAN, click and drag the "new LAN" icon in the palette
to the work area.</li>
<p>
<li>To link a node to a LAN, click the node, then hold "ctrl" and
click on the LAN you want to link it to (or vice versa.)</li>
<p>
<li>Note that you may not link a LAN directly to a LAN.
<p>
<li>Nodes and LANs may be moved around the work area by clicking and
dragging them.</li>
<p>
<li>Nodes, links, and LANs may be eliminated by dragging them into the trash.</li> 
<p>
<li>Little circles between links and nodes represent the network
interface on that node, and may not be moved or eliminated (though
eliminating the attached link will get rid of them.)</li>
<p>
<li>When your experiment topology has been built, clicking "create
experiment" will take you into the testbed experiment creation
page; from there, you may view the generated NS file as well as create
an actual experiment.</li>
</list>
<p>

<h2>Selection:</h2>
<list>
<li>Clicking a single item in the work area will select it.</li>
<p>
<li>Clicking a single item while holding down shift will add it to the
pool of selected items (unless it was already selected, then it will
become deselected.)</li>
<p>
<li>Clicking an empty part of the canvas will deselect everything.</li>
<p>
<li>Clicking an empty part of the canvas and dragging will create a
selection rectangle. When the mouse button is released, all items in
the rectangle will be selected.</li>
<p>
<li>When multiple items are selected, clicking one selected item and
dragging it will drag all selected items.</li>
<p>
<li>When multiple items are selected, clicking one selected item and 
dragging it into the trash will eliminate all selected items.</li>
</list>
<p>

<h2>Properties:</h2>
<list>
<li>When one item is selected, a properties view will open in the
rightmost panel. This is where properties, including name, may be
set.</li>
<p>
<li>Invalid characters typed into a properties text box will be
ignored.</li>
<p>
<li>If a property is "&lt;auto&gt;," it will automatically be determined in
the experiment creation process. Change this to specify your own value
for the property.</li>
<p>
<li>Clicking "default" will reset the property of the adjoining box to
its default value (in many cases "&lt;auto&gt;.")</li> 
<p>
<li>If multiple items of the same type are selected, some boxes may
show up as "&lt;multiple&gt;." This means that the value of this property is
different between at least two nodes in the selection. Changing such a
property value (or setting it to default) will result in <i>all</i> 
selected nodes assuming the new value for that property. Some
properties (such as name and IP address) may not be set simultaneously
in this way.</li>
<p>
<li>If multiple items of varying types are selected, the property
boxes will still appear on the right, but may be in a collapsed state.
Clicking the '+' will expand one of these.</li> 
<p>
<li>Clicking the '-' on an expanded box will collapse it again.</li>
<p>
<li>Click "copy selection" to make a duplicate of the current
selection.</li>
</list>
