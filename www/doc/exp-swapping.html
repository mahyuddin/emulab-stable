     <h3>Experiments: Swapping</h3>
<a name="swapping"></a>


<p>
Swapping is the process of instantiating your experiment,
i.e., allocating nodes, configuring links, etc. It also refers 
to the reverse process, in which nodes are released. These are
called "swapping in" and "swapping out" respectively. Swapping is when you (or 
we, or the Emulab system) temporarily swaps
    out your experiment,
    releasing all of the nodes in the experiment. Your experiment is
    still resident in the Emulab database, and you can see its status
    in the web interface, but no nodes are allocated.
	</p>
	<P>In general, you should do your work, and then
    terminate your experiment as soon as you're done with it. If
    you're not done with it, but are through for a while, you should
    probably "swap out" your experiment  It is
    especially important to swap out your experiment if you're through
    with it for the weekend. Emulab usually gets heavy use on the
    weekends by users who need to make very large experiments, so it
    is important to leave as many nodes available as possible.
    </p>

    <b>Caution</b>: Be aware that we do not currently save any files that you 
	may have
    placed on your nodes. When your experiment is swapped back in, you
    will likely get different nodes, with fresh copies of the disk
    images. For that reason, you should not swap your experiment out
    unless you make arrangements to save and restore any state you need.
    </p>

	<p>Once an
    experiment is swapped out, you can swap it back in via the web
    interface by going to the Experiment Information page for your
    experiment, and clicking on the swapin option. See the Project File Storage
	module for more information <!-- link here --></p>
 
	<p>You will sometimes
    notice that the Experiment Information page does not contain the swap
    link. That is because experiments cannot be swapped when they are in
    transition. For example, when the experiment is being swapped in (say,
    after first being created) the link will disappear until the experiment
    is fully swapped in, and it is capable of being swapped out. You will
    need to occasionally reload the page so that the updated state is
    recognized and the swap link appears. </p>
