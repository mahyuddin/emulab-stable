Added support for uploading SSH protocol 2 public keys via the web
interface. Previously, only protocol 1 keys were allowed. Also added
support for converting SSH2 (<a href=www.ssh.com>SSH Communications</a>)
and SECSH public key files into <a href=www.openssh.org>OpenSSH</a>
key format, which is what Emulab uses internally. This should solve
the problems people have reported with their public keys being
rejected by Emulab!
