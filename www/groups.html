<h2>Project Groups</h2>
</center>

<p>
As an instructional aid, project leaders may designate TAs to lead
small groups of project members. This is accomplished by creating a
<em>group</em> (sometimes referred to as a "subgroup"), and
designating the TA as the leader of the group.  A project group is a
lot like a unix group, and in fact unix groups is the mechanism used
to protect members of one group from members of another group on
Emulab nodes. For each group created, a new unix group is created, and
the members of the group added. When a group member starts an
experiment, he/she indicates the group in the Begin Experiment
form. All of the nodes in the experiment will have user accounts built
for only those members of the group. In this way, multiple subgroups
of a project can work independently, and be protected from each other
via the generally well understood unix group protection mechanism.
</p>

<p>
As project leader, you may create and destroy groups, and add and
remove project members from your groups. You are automatically a
member of new groups you create; even though you are not the
designated leader of the group, you still retain all of the same
permissions that you have as project leader, within the group. This
means that you can terminate experiments that have been created within
the group, and edit the personal information for group members. To
create a group, simply go to the Project Information link at your
left, and look for the "Create New Group" link, or go to the <a
href=https://www.emulab.net/newgroup_form.php3>Create New Group</a>
page directly.  Once you have created a group, you can edit the
members of the group by clicking on the "Edit" option in the group
information page.
</p>

<p>
As group leader, you may approve new user applications to join your
group.  You may also create and destroy experiments created within the
group. If you are a TA managing a group, you can have new Emulab users
<em>Join</em> your group by telling them to go to the <a
href=https://www.emulab.net/addusr.php3>Join Project</a> link at your
left, and specifying the name of your group where it asks for a group
name. You will receive an email message for each person that applies
to join your group. To approve (or deny) membership in your group, use
the <a href=https://www.emulab.net/approveuser_form.php3>New User
Approval</a> link. If the user who wishes to join your group is
already a member of the project, then the project leader must add them
to your group. In other words, there is no mechanism to join multiple
groups via a web form; the Project Leader must do it on the Edit Group
page.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned above, unix groups are used to protect members one group
from members of another group. User may create shared directories by
using the unix "chgrp" command. When accounts are created on the
experimental nodes after a new experiment is started, only those
members of the group will get accounts on the nodes; other members of
the same project, not in the group, will not get accounts.
