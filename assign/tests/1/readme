Physical topology:

4 switches

All links 100 MBs

Switch 0,1: 8 nodes with 4 links each
Switch 2: 12 nodes with 3 links each
Switch 3: 4 nodes with 2 links each

All switches connected at 500 Mbs except switch 3 which is connected
at 200 Mbs.

Tests:

A: Basic test >-<
B: Can fit in one switch.  8 interconnected nodes.
C: Can fit in three switches. 25 interconnected nodes.
D: Can barely work. 32 nodes no delays.
E: Can barely work.
F: Can't work.
