running
-------

Typically assign is run in the following method:
	assign -t <ptop> <top>

-h provides a brief help listing.  -a does nothing.  -b does nothing.
-t specifies a ptop file and is mandatory.  -o does very little of use.


ptop format
-----------
Each line is one either:

node <node> <types> [- <features>]

<node> is a string identifier for the node.

<types> is a space separated list of <type>:<number>. 
	<type> is a string identifier for the type.
	<number> is the number of virtual nodes of that type that can fit.
There is a special type of "switch" which indicates that the node is a
switch.

<features> is a space separated list of <feature>:<cost>
	<feature> is a string identifier of the feature.
	<cost> is the cost of the feature being wasted.

OR

link <link> <src>[:<smac>] <dst>[:<dmac>] <bw> <numb>

<link> is a string identifier for the link.

<src>,<dst> are the source and destination nodes.

<smac>,<dmac> are optional arguments which are the MAC addresses or any
	other string to distinguish the ports of the nodes.  If committed
	the string "(null)" is used instead.

<bw> is the bandwidth, an integer.

<num> is the number of links between those two pairs.

Note: <smac> and <dmac> should not be present on switch<->switch links.

top format
----------

Each line is either:

node <node> <type> [<desires>]

<node> is a string identifier for the node.

<type> is the type of the node.

<desires> is a space separated list of <desire>:<weight>
	<desire> is a string identifier of the desire.
	<weight> is the cost of not having the desire fulfilled.
		A weight >= 1.0 will also result in a violation if
		not filled.

OR

link <src> <dst> <bw>

features and desires
--------------------

Each physical node has feature/cost pairs associated with it.  Each
virtual node has desire/weight pairs associated with it.  When a
mapping is made any unused features add their cost to the score and
any unfulfilled desires add their weight to the score.  Fulfilled
desires/used features add nothing to the score.

environmental variables
-----------------------

ASSIGN_SEED - If present will cause assign to use the value as its
random number seed.  Otherwise the seed is taken from the current
time.

compile time options
--------------------

-DVERBOSE adds temperature output and functions as a crude progress meter.

-DSCORE_DEBUG adds a large amount of output detailing in great detail
what is going on.

-DSCORE_DEBUG_MORE adds even more output.
