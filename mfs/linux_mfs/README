This is the build tree for the Linux-based frisbee MFS.

This can probably only be compiled on a Linux machine.

To build the toolchain for the Linux MFS, do this ($ARCH is either
i386 or x86_64):

# cd testbed/mfs/linux_mfs
# scp ops:/share/linux/mfs/source tarballs
# tar xvjf tarballs/buildroot-20081211.tar.bz2
# cp source/buildroot/buildroot.config.$ARCH buildroot/.config
# cd buildroot
# make oldconfig
# make

Once that's done, edit testbed/mfs/linux_mfs/Makefile and set the ARCH
variable appropriately, then run 'make initramfs'.  If everything
works, the boot/ directory will have the kernel and initramfs.

The kernel is compiled but not installed anywhere.  You'll have to pull
it out of the build tree for now.

TODO
----
Lots of small things.  I've tested the tmcc and frisbee functionality of
the image, but it's not really automated yet.  The necessary scripts are
all there, but not yet tested.

BUGS
----
- There are no docs (except this, and it sucks).
- The build system needs some work:
  - There are occasional problems building the toolchain.  These are due
    to weird bugs in the gcc build process that I haven't figured out a
    good fix for.
  - There are some minor dependency issues in building some of the
    targets that cause other targets to be rebuilt unnecessarily.
