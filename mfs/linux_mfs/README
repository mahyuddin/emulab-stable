This is the build tree for the Linux-based frisbee MFS.

In order to actually build anything, you'll need a whole bunch of source
tarballs.  They can be found in ops:/share/linux/mfs/source.  Just rsync
or scp that whole tree on top of the 'source' subdirectory in this tree.

This can probably only be compiled on a Linux machine.

To build, run "make build-env" to build the cross-compiling uClibc
toolchain.  Then run "make target" to compile all of the source for the
initramfs.

Finally, run "make target-initramfs" to create a compressed cpio archive
suitable to use as an initramfs.

The kernel is compiled but not installed anywhere.  You'll have to pull
it out of the build tree for now.

TODO
----
Lots of small things.  I've tested the tmcc and frisbee functionality of
the image, but it's not really automated yet.  The necessary scripts are
all there, but not yet tested.

BUGS
----
- There are no docs (except this, and it sucks).
- The build system needs some work:
  - The kernel image isn't installed anywhere
  - There are occasional problems building the toolchain.  These are due
    to weird bugs in the gcc build process that I haven't figured out a
    good fix for.
  - There are some minor dependency issues in building some of the
    targets that cause other targets to be rebuilt unnecessarily.
- Documentation sucks.
- The hotplug scripts that work with mdev (busybox's stripped-down udev)
  need to be cleaned up a bit.
