This is the build tree for the Linux-based Frisbee/admin/newnode MFS.

This can probably only be compiled on a Linux machine.

COMPILING
---------
- Install the fakeroot package (fakeroot.alioth.debian.org)
- Edit the top-level Makefile and set the MFS_ARCH variable to i386 for
  a 32-bit build or x86_64 for a 64-bit build.
- Set TESTBED_PATH and TESTBEDOBJ_PATH in source/testbed/Makefile to
  the location of your Emulab source tree and your build tree
  respectively.
- Download the source tarballs from ops via scp into a 'tarballs'
  directory: 'scp ops:/share/linux/mfs/source tarballs'
- Run 'make' (or 'make toolchain' for the compiler and 'make initramfs'
  for the kernel and initramfs).

BUGS
----
- There are no docs (except this, and it sucks).
- The build system needs some work:
  - There are occasional problems building the toolchain.  These are due
    to weird bugs in the gcc build process that I haven't figured out a
    good fix for.
  - There are some minor dependency issues in building some of the
    targets that cause other targets to be rebuilt unnecessarily.
