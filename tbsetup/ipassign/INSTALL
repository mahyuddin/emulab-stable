ipassign requires the METIS library.

This is compiled with the rest of Emulab build process. If you wish to run automated regression testing, you will have to build that seperately. Simply compile src/autocheck.cc into bin/autocheck and compile src/boolcmp.cc into bin/boolcmp and then run bin/autocheck. Make sure that you are in the ipassign directory so that autocheck can find the configuration file in etc/autocheck.conf
