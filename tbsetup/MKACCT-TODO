finished.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
STUFF TO SET UP USER ACCOUNTS, DIRECTORIES ON CONTROL AND TESTBED NODES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- to finish mkacct-ctrl, version 1: 
	- finish pw call in mkacct-ctrl
	-  move user dir creation from mkacct to mkacct-ctrl

- add installation stuff to makefiles (similar to mkprojdir)
  for mkacct stuff. all must be setuid root.

- remove user dir tar & removal from rmacct to rmacct-ctrl (see
  note about rmacct-ctrl below)

- fix privs in mkacct and rmacct to check that:
	- the $UID (real user ID)  has group_root in the project OR    
	- $UID = 0
	- the $UID has admin privs
  (currently, only check is that user is root (tbroot works))

- add quota call (2-5MB) to /users in mkacct-ctrl

- create a script to modify plastic's exports file on each expt
  creation/deletion to export/unexport /proj/$pid to those nodes
  and HUP mountd. 

- do the same for /user/<users> dirs; called from mkacct.

- create a script to rebuild the tb-user email list. call when a 
	user is added. build from scratch using database fields
     	(general principle for db).

- rewrite mkacct because it sucks. it uses chpass and a gazillion
  piped shell commands, some of which can be eliminated by using pw
  or built-in shell functions (like chmod(), for example)

- add hooks for mkacct/rmacct into tbrun/end

- do rmacct-ctrl: remove accounts from control node; called when
	user removed from database. because there is no 
	form to kill a project now, this can probably wait. 

- check to see where we need to use "lockfile" in mkacct/rmacct stuff. 
	From email:

	We have no locking protocol right now, except for the node allocation
	stuff in tbprerun.

	I agree about hardlinks. Actually, I use "lockfile" from the procmail
	distribution. Do "man lockfile" on moab. It does the simple hardlink
	trick, and you specify the filename to use as the lock. It has some nice
	options for retries and timeouts. We can just use a copy of that that is
	not setgid mail.
