tbsetup

Syntax:
	tbprerun <pid> <eid> <ns-file>

tbprerun does all tasks necessary to setup up for an experiment on the
testbed.  It generates an IR file that can be used with 'tbrun' to
actually configure the testbed.

CAVEAT: This does do actual reservation of nodes.  Be sure to free the
nodes using tbend, even if you never run the experiment.


tbrun

Syntax:
	tbrun <pid> <eid> <ir-file>

tbrun setups up the testbed for the experiment.  


tbreport

Syntax:
	tbreport [-v] <ir-file>

tbreport parses the IR file and produces a human readable report on
the contents.  -v will include extra information.


tbend

Syntax:
	tbend <pid> <eid>

tbend does tear down. 
This should be run at the end of every experiment even if nothing was
done in the experiment.
