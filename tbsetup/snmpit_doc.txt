Documentation for snmpit 
------------------------

snmpit uses modules that implement the interface to a given switch
model (ie Cisco Catalyst 6509, Intel EhterExpress 510T, etc). They are
responsable for all communication (typically over SNMP) to the switch. 

The organization is basically that snmpit itself deals with stack objects,
which deal with (possibly multiple) switch objects on the backend. So, snmpit
makes a snmpit_cisco_stack object, and gives it a list of switches, which
snmpit_cisco_stack uses to create a snmpit_cisco object for each switch. The
stack objects basically just know how to do things like the the VLAN lists from
all of their switches and collate them into one big list that they can return
to the caller.

The API for the stack objects is currently not documented - look at one of the
existing ones.
