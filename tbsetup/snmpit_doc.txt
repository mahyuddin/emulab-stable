Documentation for snmpit 
------------------------

snmpit uses modules that implement the interface to a given switch
model (ie Cisco Catalyst 6509, Intel EhterExpress 510T, etc). They are
responsable for all communication (typically over SNMP) to the switch. 
These modules should support these actions:

new(ip,args)	Initializes snmp session to IP, "arg=val" sets
		module parameters, ignores unsupported args
portControl(cmd,ports)
		cmd = {enable, disable, 10mbit, 100mbit, full, half, auto}
		ports = list of "pcX:Y"
showPorts	print settings of all ports
getStats	print various stats
vlanLock	Get a vlan editing lock/token/buffer, and
vlanUnlock	Release it when done
setupVlan	(name,ports) - takes a list of ports, and vlans them
removeVlan	(vlan) - takes vlan number
listVlans	returns a list of entries, with each entry having an
		ID, a name, and a list of members (pcX:Y)

Notes:
showPorts and getStats currently print their results directly. This
makes sense, since the output could be quite different for different
switch types. This also prevents snmpit itself from using these
functions to determine certain things about the state. In the future,
it would be good to have them return data structures, like listVlans
does, and have snmpit be able to use this info.

Features supported in snmpit itself:
 - auto vlan config from file or from db
 - device type discovery and command dispatch

Power control has also been moved into its own module, snmpit_apc.pm. 
It supports new(ip,args) as above, and power(cmd,port) where cmd is 
"on", "off", or "cyc[le]" and port is 1-8.

snmpit library interface
------------------------
init(dbname)		    initialize the module
macport(pcX:Y || MAC)       return MAC || pcX:Y address respectively
portnum(pcX:Y || node:port) return node:mod.port or pcX:Y
Dev(name || IP)             return IP/name
NodeCheck(pcX:Y)	    return true (1) if okay, false (0) if it failed
tableVlans(pid,eid)         returns hash: key=id, val=members

The snmpit library handles all the database stuff (except some power
control info). It makes available all the translations that a module
might need to do.
