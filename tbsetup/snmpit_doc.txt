Documentation for snmpit 
------------------------

snmpit uses modules that implement the interface to a given switch
model. These modules should support these actions:

new(ip,args)	Initializes snmp session to IP, "arg=val" sets
		module parameters, ignoring unsupported ones
portControl(cmd,ports)
		cmd = {enable, disable, 10mbit, 100mbit, full, half, auto}
		ports = list of "pcX:Y"
showPorts	print settings of all ports
getStats	print various stats
vlanLock	Get a vlan editing lock/token/buffer, and
vlanUnlock	Release it when done
setupVlan	(name,ports) - takes a list of ports, and vlans them
removeVlan	(vlan) - takes vlan number
listVlans	returns a list of entries, with each entry having an
		ID, a name, and a list of members (pcX:Y)

Notes:
showPorts and getStats currently print their results directly. This
makes sense, since the output could be quite different for different
switch types. This also prevents snmpit itself from using these
functions to determine certain things about the state. In the future,
it would be good to have them return data structures, like listVlans
does, and have snmpit be able to use this info.

Supported in snmpit:	autovlanconfig from file, db
			Power control
			printing list of vlans
			device type discovery

snmpit library interface
------------------------
macport(pcX:Y || MAC)	return MAC || pcX:Y address respectively
portnum(pcX:Y)		return node:port (or node:mod.port)
NodeCheck(node)		return true (1) if okay, false (0) if it failed
